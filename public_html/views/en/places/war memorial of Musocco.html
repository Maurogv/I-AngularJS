	<h2 class="content">Features of the Memorial of World War I</h2>
</div>
<p>Once the world war ended, sowing mourning and crying everywhere in Europe, the municipality of Musocco, like many other Italian municipalities, acknowledges and welcomes the desire of family members, veterans and the local community to remember the fallen soldier in the war in a concrete way. The common solution is to bring the fallen together in a funeral monument, located in a representative place, and generally of a size not to go unnoticed, to be an integral part of social life. The new feature compared to the past is that the memorial, although not having a direct bind to the body of the fallen, not only celebrates the courage and the value of the army, but identifies them individually. Symbolically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_memorial">war memorial</a> must offer an acceptable context for death in battle, trying to give it an ideal meaning, to make it sacred. The consolation of the pain of both the dying and the comrades and survivors is entrusted to religion through Christian symbols, which has the function of mediating the tragic death. In this context of piety, it must not forget to represent the victorious outcome of the war, in which Italy defeated the Austro-Hungarian empire, which makes the sacrifice of soldiers less bitter.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Description</h2>
</div>
<p>The work that was born from the piety of the citizens of Musocco for the sacrifice of its soldiers in the First World War, who died for Italy between 1915 and 1918, was realized thanks to the intervention of local politics in a war memorial, monument <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_memorial#Types">type</a>, in the center of the Municipal Square, now Piazzale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annibale_Santorre_di_Rossi_de_Pomarolo,_Count_of_Santarosa">Santorre of Santarosa</a>. The <b>monument to the fallen of Musocco</b> is of considerable size, satisfying the requirement of visibility, and proportionate to the size of the square.</p>

<p>A column, that raises perhaps up to 10 meters high, at the top of which there is a wrought iron crown, is inserted in a rather high square base, worked in flounces that has two vertical blocks with epigraphs, elements that support <a href="#warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_female_marble_statues">two female marble statues</a> in painful act. The two sculptures are in opposite directions, east side and west side of the monument. One is the typical representation of Italy, which it has wrote in the block below <i>Musocco ai suoi gloriosi caduti</i>, that is Musocco to its glorious fallen; the other one, similar to the first, has in her hand the book <i>Storia</i>, meaning History, with under it the two dates of the beginning and end of the conflict for Italy, <i>XXIV-V-MCMXV</i> and <i>IV-XI-MCMXVIII</i>. The iron crown weighs down the monument without obtaining an effective scenographic result, and could be a symbol of victory and spiritual elevation; it seems decorated with leaves, which could symbolize immortality. To the north and south, at the level of the man's gaze, there are <a href="#warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_bronze_bas-reliefs">two bronze bas-reliefs</a>. Under the iron crown, on the supporting column, to the south and to the north, there are two identical distinctive elements, rounded pentagonal shape, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscione">biscione</a>, the heraldic symbol which is one of the symbols of Milan, and another engraving. The wall structure of the monument is surrounded by a flower bed, enclosed by pylons supporting chains, in which there are <a href="warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_tombstones_with_the_names_of_the_fallen">two tombstones with the names of the fallen Musocco's soldiers</a>, positioned under the two bas-reliefs. On a bronze plaque is written <i>Ugo Prat</i>, probably the artist who created some of the sculptures.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial_of_Musocco'>War Memorial of Musocco</a> is symmetrical, elegant and of good artistic value, in art deco style that distinguishes it from the classical heaviness of many other monuments to the fallen. It can be observed especially in the actually sumptuous clothing of the two women and in the posture of the bent and raised arm.</p>

<p>The area surrounding the monument is not valued by the city of Milan, as well as the square. The sidewalk is anonymous, even worse than the others on the outskirts of the city already ugly, the asphalt is a dirty gray color, with bulges and tire marks, the edge is rough. Another flaw is that this site no reflects the circular shape of the square, and extends in some way according to the tram tracks. Last but not least, this precise place of memory, wanted by the Musocchesi to commemorate their loved ones and acquaintances dead fighting in the 1915-1918 War or for their injuries, is not accessible to the visitor without being forced to make an infringement because there are no pedestrian crossing.</p>

<p>The two main elements of the <b>World War I Memorial of Musocco</b> are the two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble">marble</a> statues of female figures, both for their size, about 3 meters high and raised from the ground above the height of man, and for symbolism.</p>

<p>A statue of a woman is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_turrita">Italia turrita</a>, the national personification of Italy, portrayed in an attitude of pain. In fact, the statue facing east, in the direction of Via Giovanni Battista De Rossi, is dressed in a long sumptuous dress and with a cloak over it, her head is covered by a tower, which looks like a helmet, from which braided hair descends, in her right hand she holds a rod or a beam that rests on the ground. The left arm is raised with the hand that touches the head, as a sign of pain for the fallen and that reflects the feeling of the family and the community. For the personification this statue is called <i>Italia</i>, that is Italy. On the plaque that holds it is written on two lines in capital letters: <em>Musocco ai suoi gloriosi caduti</em>, in English Musocco to its glorious fallen.<br>
	The other statue is also a woman, similar to the first sculpture, dressed in a long tunic and a cloak over it, with a pitiful face and performing the same act of pain, with the left arm bent and the hand on the head. This statue, facing west in the direction of Via Bernardino Galliari, holds a book in her right hand, which it wrote <i>Storia</i> (History), and so it is called. The statue rests on a marble plaque, where two dates are indicated in Roman numerals, the start date and the end date of the Great War for Italy: <em>XXIV-V-MCMXV</em> and <em>IV-XI-MCMXVIII</em>, 24 May 1915 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollettino_della_Vittoria">4 November 1918</a>.</p>

<p>Two bronze <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief#Low_relief_or_bas-relief">bas-reliefs</a> of black color are the sculptural element, with which, together with the <a href="#warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_female_marble_statues">two statues of woman</a>, the symbolism of the monument to the fallen of Musocco was realized, of pity and respect for the dead soldiers, almost all young. The third fundamental element is constituted by the <a href="warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_tombstones_with_the_names_of_the_fallen">plaques with the names of the fallen</a>, which are found in the enclosed flowerbed of the memorial under the two bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs are facing Viale Carlo Espinasse, north side and south side of the monument, at a height that facilitates the vision and leads to a time of recollection. Both are inspired by the Christian religion, which has a mediation function, one is a religious celebration, the other is the death of a soldier.</p>

<p>In the bas-relief of the north side of the monument, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)">mass</a> is celebrated, captured when the officiant, facing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altar">altar</a>, elevates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist">Eucharist</a>. A gathering of soldiers in uniform and with a helmet attends the religious ceremony, which commemorates the sacrifice of one or more fallen for the homeland. The soldiers in the foreground are represented from the shoulders and sideways, while, near the altar and more distant, a crowd of people attends the ceremony. These are the expression of the participation and closeness of the people to the duty dangerously done by the soldiers. Mass is outdoors, in fact a tree is behind the altar.</p>

<p>In the bronze bas-relief of the southern side of the monument to the fallen of Musocco, in the direction of Piazzale Accursio, a soldier in relief sitting on the ground, wounded and probably dying, turns to seek relief with his left arm extended and the hand open towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Christ</a>, who radiates him with light, symbol of eternal salvation. Behind the human figure in relief there are trees. On the ground, under Jesus, lies a fallen man, he too under the field of light rays.</p>

	<h2 class="content">The two tombstones with the names of the fallen</h2>
</div>
<p>The names of the fallen soldiers is the great innovative element of the monuments to the fallen of the First World War, generally written in the form of a list in one or more tombstones. This operation transforms the memorials of war until then celebratory into funerary, even without the presence of the bodies of the fallen. They become places of memory of soldiers who gave their lives for the defense of the homeland. The fallen are identified with name and surname, date of birth and death, or alternatively the age of death, if not even a photo in military uniform. The names are listed in alphabetical order, creating equality in the face of death, which does not fail even when there is the rank in the army.</p>

<p>Musocco's soldiers who fell during the Great War are listed in alphabetical order in two white marble tablets tilted in the grass of the flowerbed surrounding the masonry structure of the memorial, where beautiful rose plants grow. The two tombstones are under the <a href="#warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_bronze_bas-reliefs">two bas-reliefs</a>, north and south side of the monument, position that establishes a relationship with the religious message of the two scenes. Each fallen is identified by surname and name, date of birth and death. The dead are so numerous that each tombstone has three columns.</p>

<p>On the first plaque 84 names are written and in the second 83. Altogether, War Memorial of Musocco commemorates 167 soldiers who died in the First World War for Italy. Twenty-four fell in 1915, five in 1916, fifty-one in 1917, fifty-two in 1918 and four in 1919</p>

<p>Finding the names of the fallen written was the thing that surprised me most and exalted when I carefully visited the <b>Memorial of Piazzale Santorre di Santarosa</b> way back in 2012. Similarly, the biggest thrill of this writing was to list those surnames, which sounded familiar to me. In fact, classmates, people from Quarto Oggiaro where I grew up, inhabitants of my house and of Via Barnaba Oriani are homonymous, and perhaps grandchildren, of the fallen in the war, and so were some of my father's colleagues, who had worked at IVI, Industrie Vernici Italiane, at Bovisetta, between the two railway stations.</p>

	<h2 class="content">The fallen of Musocco in the Albo d'Oro of the Fallen and Missing of the 1st World War</h2> 
</div>
<p>The <i>Albo d'Oro</i> (Honor Roll) of the Italians fallen in the world war is a twenty-eight volume document, officially published starting from 6 June 1926 by the Ministry of War in compliance with the Royal Decree n. 2130 of 22 November 1925.<my-ref>^</my-ref> They contain 529,025 names of Italians who died of causes directly attributable to the First World War. This is a partial list: already in 1925, in the same governmental framework, the estimate of the fallen "by direct and well-established cause of war" was 652,000, while 750,000 were counted including the dead "for reasons of war". Today the sheets of these books are digitized and the information of the fallen are in a database of the Ministry of Defense,<my-ref>^</my-ref> which can also be consulted through some websites sponsored by the ministry. The data of each fallen are: name, paternity, date and place of birth, grade, corps, date and place of death, cause of death, decorations.</p>

<p>Palma Antonio Barbalinardo in his recent book Fragments of history of the fallen of Musocco and surroundings of the First World War 1915-1918,<my-ref>^</my-ref> has copied, from the Caduti della Grande Guerra website,<my-ref>^</my-ref> the information of every fallen that appears in the War Memorial of Musocco.<br>
	From this interesting research it emerges that many of the fallen of the War Memorial of Musocco were born in the municipality of Musocco, others in the surrounding municipalities, such as Milan, Trenno, Bollate, Novate Milanese or more generally in Lombardy. Thus in the world war died Bianchi, Brambilla, Brioschi, Casati, Figini, Fossati, Fumagalli, Galbiati, Ghezzi, Mariani, Pedretti, Perego, Tagliabue, Viganò, Villa, just to name a few, which are typically Milanese surnames. Most had the rank of soldier, there were corporals and two sergeants. The most numerous were in the infantry regiment, then bersaglieri, artillerymen, machine-gunners, Fossati Geronzio was a corporal of aeronautics. The glorious fallen of Musocco fought against the Austro-Hungarian army in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_the_Isonzo">12 battles of the Isonzo</a>, from 24 May 1915, the beginning of the great war for Italy, until the battle of Caporetto (24 October-7 November 1917), ended with the famous defeat, dying to conquer a few meters of land and rock in the Karst mountains, Monte San Gabriele, Monte San Michele, Monte Nero, Monte Altissimo. Four of the 167 mentioned in the War Memorial of Musocco have died on foreign fronts, Albania, Macedonia and Libya. And then on the Asiago altopiano, Monte Grappa, Monte Pasubio, on the Piave, in a war that will end with the victorious entry of the Italian army in Trento, on 3 November 1918. Some died in the field hospital due to injuries sustained in combat, due to illness, in Milan, following poison gas actions, two under an avalanche.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Recent restorations</h2>
</div>
<p>Time acts hard on the preservation of monuments to the fallen, damaging the marble and rendering the name of the fallen unreadable.</p>

<p>In 2008, on the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I, the war memorial of Musocco was restored by the municipality of Milan. The memorial, it seems impossible, had not been retrained for about 30 years and the names of the fallen were illegible from at least a dozen!<my-ref>^</my-ref> It was a half-done job if, as is true, a metal band was left to hold the marbles of the upper part together.<br>
	In the first three months of 2017, during the centenary of the great war, another restoration followed. The intervention, rather complex for the more delicate parts and deteriorated by external agents, concerned both the two marble statues representing Italy and History, and the two bronze bas-reliefs that illustrate the religious implications of the death of the soldiers. In addition to the surface cleaning, they were consolidated the damaged parts and reconstructed the joints and seals of the basement and statues.<my-ref>^</my-ref></p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">One hundred years have passed ...</h2>
</div>
<p>The massacre of the First World War, to which fighters were dedicated many monuments to the fallen scattered in Europee, was not enough to prevent a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">Second World War</a>, even more terrible.<br>
	To preserve the memory of those tragic events, many War Memorial of First World War were retouched by adding the names of the soldiers of the Second War. This possibility was excluded for the War Memorial of Musocco because the municipality of Musocco was dissolved and aggregated in Milan in 1923.</p>

<p>In Italian municipalities, celebrations near at War Memorials on anniversaries for the First World War have become increasingly rare. At most, ceremonies, usually attended by few people, organized by Partisan associations, are held on April 25th, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Day_(Italy)">Anniversary of the Liberation of Italy</a> from the fascist government, thus accumulating the deaths of the first and second war, recollection that takes place also at the <b>Musocco's War Memorial</b>. The monuments to the fallen are therefore today civil symbols of the urban fabric rather than funerary monuments. Only a small official commemoration was held during the centenary of the First World War at the <b>War Memorial of Musocco in Piazzale Santorre di Santarosa</b>, exactly three years after the beginning of the conflict,<my-ref>^</my-ref> a sign that the popular push is exhausted for some time.<br>
	In some European countries instead the memory of the first war is much more alive and celebrated, especially in those on whose soil it was fought bitterly, Belgium, France, Germany, and in England.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago the soldiers were sent to the trenches to fight by European rulers and politicians who wanted a war for territorial supremacy, which turned into a world war. In the renewed attempt to stop it, on 1 August 1917 in the "Letter of the Holy Father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XV">Benedict XV</a> to the leaders of the belligerent peoples", it was defined by the Roman Pontiff sensless massacre. Today the War Memorial of Musocco, raised on pressure from the local community in order to preserve the memory of the First World War in the future by honoring the glorious fallen of Musocco with symbols of pain and Christians, is for motorists a mysterious artifact to circumvent located in middle of a square. The sons of soldiers are now dead and perhaps even the first grandchildren, so the memory of the war events of the First World War is entrusted to history. For the inhabitants of this territory of the north-western suburbs of Milan the <b>War Memorial in Piazzale Santorre di Santarosa</b> is invisible because they do not matter the local history, and forgetting they lose the right pride that comes from the past. The consequence is that in the face of this as of so many other war memorials, that process of estrangement has been consummated, part of a more general split between the individual and the community to which they belong. The experience of human life recorded by history remains a source of teaching for future generations, the first lesson is not to repeat the mistakes of the past, on top of which is repudiating the war in favor of peace.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">What it represents to me</h2>
</div>
<p>My interest in the War Memorial of Musocco stems from the proximity of the monument and from my personal vicissitudes, whose most visible manifestation is walking in the neighborhood and was taking photographs; it is not to be neglected to have always lived in the same place and my curiosity for local history. My meeting with the monument was not influenced, as one might think, by the human contribution that also my family gave for Italy. In fact, Enrico Portaluppi, my mother's grandfather, from whom she took her feminine name, Enrica, lost his life in World War I on 25 July 1915 on Monte San Michele in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_the_Isonzo">second battle of the Isonzo</a> under the command of General Luigi Cadorna; Mario was orphaned at the age of two. Giovanni Vezzoli, the father of Giocondo, who is the father of Mauro, the writer, told of war injuries in Albania, enlisted in the Greek army since he was born in Corfu where my Italian family formed by emigrating. The association of the lived common experience of my ancestors and the fallen and the people of Musocco began only later.</p>

<p>War Memorial of Musocco is important to me today because I dedicated a profitable time to this writing, which partially fills the little written documentation on the monument. The first version published as a Wikipedia entry is from the period 2012-2013, while this, written between June and August 2019, is accessible on the Internet via CDN from my GitHub website account.<my-ref>^</my-ref> The <b>War Memorial of Piazzale Santorre di Santarosa</b> is dear to me: in fact every time I connect to facebook I have seen for years the photo of my profile fixed on an image that portrays me in front of the bas-relief of the south side of the monument, where there is a soldier wounded to death who finds consolation in the light of Jesus; out of the cutout, below is one of the two tombstones of the monument with the names of the fallen. I walk in the neighborhood due to a chronic back pain due to a fall on my butt when I was 18, which prevented me from continuing to do competitive sport and hindered me in my study, as in my job placement. The pain was made worse by the inability of doctors to make a diagnosis, belonging to the national health service of my country, and by dentists. Faced with this memorial of war built by political power, which rightly complied with the popular will for the tragic events of 1915-1918, I seem to be an Alpine who has dangerously accomplished his duty, sent to the front by ignorant and superb people, who does not learn from their mistakes.</p>

		<span>... in Piazzale Santorre di Santarosa, where you can admire the Monument to the Fallen by the sculptor U. Prat, which was conceived in this way: a high plinth holds two stelae of marble that are surmounted by a crown of wrought iron. Two marble statues, on the sides, want to portray Italy and History. Below you can admire the bronze bas-reliefs: a soldier falls in sacrifice for a victorious Italy and a gathering of soldiers religiously accompanies the sacrifice of a Holy Mass at the camp. All in a sacrificial setting to remember the unknown martyrs of the homeland.</span>
