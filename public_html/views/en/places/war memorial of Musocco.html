	<h2 class="content">Features of the Memorial of World War I</h2>
</div>
<p>Once the world war ended, sowing mourning and crying everywhere in Europe, the municipality of Musocco, like many other Italian municipalities, acknowledges and welcomes the desire of family members, veterans and the local community to remember the fallen soldier in the war in a concrete way. The common solution is to bring the fallen together in a funeral monument, located in a representative place, and generally of a size not to go unnoticed, to be an integral part of social life. The new feature compared to the past is that the memorial, although not having a direct bind to the body of the fallen, not only celebrates the courage and the value of the army, but identifies them individually. Symbolically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_memorial">war memorial</a> must offer an acceptable context for death in battle, trying to give it an ideal meaning, to make it sacred. The consolation of the pain of both the dying and the comrades and survivors is entrusted to religion through Christian symbols, which has the function of mediating the tragic death. In this context of piety, it must not forget to represent the victorious outcome of the war, in which Italy defeated the Austro-Hungarian empire, which makes the sacrifice of soldiers less bitter.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Description</h2>
</div>
<p>The work that was born from the piety of the citizens of Musocco for the sacrifice of its soldiers in the First World War, who died for Italy between 1915 and 1918, was realized thanks to the intervention of local politics in a war memorial, monument <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_memorial#Types">type</a>, in the center of the Municipal Square, now Piazzale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annibale_Santorre_di_Rossi_de_Pomarolo,_Count_of_Santarosa">Santorre of Santarosa</a>. The <b>monument to the fallen of Musocco</b> is of considerable size, satisfying the requirement of visibility, and proportionate to the size of the square.</p>

<p>A rather high square base supports a column, which may reach up to 10 meters high, at the top of which there is an iron crown, and two blocks with epigraphs, which hold two female <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble">marble</a> statues in a painful act. The two sculptures are in opposite directions, east side and west side of the monument. One is the typical representation of Italy, which it has wrote in the block below <i>Musocco ai suoi gloriosi caduti</i>, that is Musocco to its glorious fallen; the other one, similar to the first, has in her hand the book <i>Storia</i>, meaning History, with under it the two dates of the beginning and end of the war for Italy, <i>XXIV-V-MCMXV</i> and <i>IV-XI-MCMXVIII</i>. To the north and south, at the level of the man's gaze, there are two bronze bas-reliefs. Under the iron crown, on the column of the southern side, there is a distinctive pentagonal-shaped rounded element with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscione">biscione</a>, the heraldic symbol which is one of the symbols of Milan, and another engraving. The wall structure of the monument is surrounded by a flower bed, enclosed by pylons supporting chains, in which there are two plaques with the names of the fallen Musocco's soldiers, positioned under the two bas-reliefs. On a bronze plaque is written <i>Ugo Prat</i>, probably the artist who created some of the sculptures.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial_of_Musocco'>War Memorial of Musocco</a> is elegant and of good artistic value, in art deco style that distinguishes it from the classical heaviness of many other monuments to the fallen. It can be observed especially in the actually sumptuous clothing of the two women and in the posture of the bent and raised arm.</p>

<p>The area surrounding the monument is not valued by the city of Milan, as well as the square. The sidewalk is anonymous, even worse than the others on the outskirts of the city already ugly, the asphalt is a dirty gray color, with a broken edge. In addition, the site no reflects the circular shape of the square, and extends in some way according to the tram tracks. Last but not least, this precise place of memory, wanted by the Musocchesi to commemorate their loved ones and acquaintances dead fighting in the 1915-1918 War or for their injuries, is not accessible to the visitor without being forced to make an infringement because there are no pedestrian crossing.</p>

<p>The two main elements of the <b>World War I Memorial of Musocco</b> are the two marble statues of female figures, both for their size, about 3 meters high and raised from the ground above the height of man, and for symbolism.</p>

<p>A statue of a woman is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_turrita">national personification of Italy</a> portrayed in an attitude of pain. In fact, the statue facing east, in the direction of Via Giovanni Battista De Rossi, is dressed in a long sumptuous dress and with a cloak over it, her head is covered by a tower, which looks like a helmet, from which braided hair descends, in her right hand she holds a rod or a beam that rests on the ground. The left arm is raised with the hand that touches the head, as a sign of pain for the fallen and that reflects the feeling of the family and the community. For the personification this statue is called <i>Italia</i>, that is Italy. On the plaque that holds it is written on two lines in capital letters: <em>Musocco ai suoi gloriosi caduti</em>, in English Musocco to his glorious fallen.<br>
	The other statue is also a woman, similar to the first sculpture, dressed in a long tunic and a cloak over it, with a pitiful face and performing the same act of pain, with the left arm bent and the hand on the head. This statue, facing west in the direction of Via Bernardino Galliari, holds a book in her right hand, which it wrote <i>Storia</i> (History), and so it is called. The statue rests on a marble plaque, where two dates are indicated in Roman numerals, the start date and the end date of the Great War for Italy: <em>XXIV-V-MCMXV</em> and <em>IV-XI-MCMXVIII</em>, 24 May 1915 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollettino_della_Vittoria">4 November 1918</a>.</p>

<p>My commitment to the writing of this page and make known the monument to the fallen of Musocco takes place about a hundred years after the tragic events of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">World War I</a> which led to many deaths in the houses of the Europeans, Italians, and inhabitant of Lombardy, Milan and Musocco. The names of the dead carved in the two tombstones, the wounded, the suffering of war have changed the feel and experience of the Europeans, who have understood the lesson of no more wars on European soil after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">Second War</a> even more terrible.<br />
	The urgency and effort for the maintenance of peace trying to understand, reduce, and in some cases remove the possible causes of any conflict of origin is one of the main purposes of the policy of each state. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy">Constitution of the</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy"> Italian Republic</a> was born after the conflict of the Second World War and the conflict has had a great influence on his writing, where Article 11<my-ref>^</my-ref> states that<em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a> repudiates war as an instrument of aggression against the freedom of other peoples and as a means of settling international disputes. Agrees, on conditions of equality with other states, to the limitations of sovereignty necessary for an orde that ensures peace and justice among Nations; promotes and encourages international organizations having such ends</em>.<br />
	There are many commemorations of those days that take place in Europe, especially in France, Belgium, England, a little less in Italy. The town of Musocco and Milan had understood the importance of remembering the war and the dead of the First World War with a large monument of good artistic value in the square in front of the building in their community.</p>

I dedicated a <a href='#eliminazioneMonumentoaicadutidiMusoccosuWikipedia'>page</a> about this with all details, in italian only. I recap in this section the deletion request by a wikipedia administrator and my overall conclusion about the italian page cancellation.</p>
<p>Italian Wikipeda administrator: As in {{<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:E" title="Template:E">E</a>}} I entered: at present is not clear from the voice that what characterizes this monument in a particular way, so as to distinguish it from the thousands of others present in the world. Precise: only in Italy there is at least one in each municipality (this is common in the former, now district of Milan). I should add that I have already removed, for obvious non-encyclopedic, the complete list of the fallen listed on the monument itself..&nbsp; --<a class="new" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Utente:Castagna&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Utente:Castagna (la pagina non esiste)">Castagna</a><a class="new" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Utente:Castagna&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Utente:Castagna (la pagina non esiste)"></a> 01:42, July, 7th 2013 (CEST). Follow the debate with myself and the response of other administrators.</p>
<p>My current conclusion: in fact, the deletion of the page War Memorial of Musocco on Wikipedia Italy, in italian Monumento ai caduti di Musocco, revolves around the reputation of the monument or its artistic value, or both. Weighs the judgment of a single administrator. A description of the page would be accepted in the page that talks about the town of Musocco, and here I will not go into other topics, but not as a stand-alone page. I&#39;m just saying that the internet is a set of linked page. <br />
	On the reputation of the monument, well a building 10 meters high which forces a change in the road network, which requires costly restoration, which is seen by thousands of people who go around every day, which commemorates the hundreds of dead from the First World War, of which among other occurs the centennial and now see in Europe manifestations reminiscent of that tragic event, which is an artist who has been to synthesize the pain of home to the soldiers who died and to give a religious significance, that...</p>
