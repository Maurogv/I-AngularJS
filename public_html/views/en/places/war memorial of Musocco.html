	<h2 class="content">Features of the Memorial of World War I</h2>
</div>
<p>Once the world war ended, sowing mourning and crying everywhere in Europe, the municipality of Musocco, like many other Italian municipalities, acknowledges and welcomes the desire of family members, veterans and the local community to remember the fallen soldier in the war in a concrete way. The common solution is to bring the fallen together in a funeral monument, located in a representative place, and generally of a size not to go unnoticed, to be an integral part of social life. The new feature compared to the past is that the memorial, although not having a direct bind to the body of the fallen, not only celebrates the courage and the value of the army, but identifies them individually. Symbolically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_memorial">war memorial</a> must offer an acceptable context for death in battle, trying to give it an ideal meaning, to make it sacred. The consolation of the pain of both the dying and the comrades and survivors is entrusted to religion through Christian symbols, which has the function of mediating the tragic death. In this context of piety, it must not forget to represent the victorious outcome of the war, in which Italy defeated the Austro-Hungarian empire, which makes the sacrifice of soldiers less bitter.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Description</h2>
</div>
<p>The work that was born from the piety of the citizens of Musocco for the sacrifice of its soldiers in the First World War, who died for Italy between 1915 and 1918, was realized thanks to the intervention of local politics in a war memorial, monument <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_memorial#Types">type</a>, in the center of the Municipal Square, now Piazzale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annibale_Santorre_di_Rossi_de_Pomarolo,_Count_of_Santarosa">Santorre of Santarosa</a>. The <b>monument to the fallen of Musocco</b> is of considerable size, satisfying the requirement of visibility, and proportionate to the size of the square.</p>

<p>A column, that raises perhaps up to 10 meters high, at the top of which there is a wrought iron crown, is inserted in a rather high square base, worked in flounces that has two vertical blocks with epigraphs, elements that support <a href="#warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_female_marble_statues">two female marble statues</a> in painful act. The two sculptures are in opposite directions, east side and west side of the monument. One is the typical representation of Italy, which it has wrote in the block below <i>Musocco ai suoi gloriosi caduti</i>, that is Musocco to its glorious fallen; the other one, similar to the first, has in her hand the book <i>Storia</i>, meaning History, with under it the two dates of the beginning and end of the conflict for Italy, <i>XXIV-V-MCMXV</i> and <i>IV-XI-MCMXVIII</i>. The iron crown weighs down the monument without obtaining an effective scenographic result, and could be a symbol of victory and spiritual elevation; it seems decorated with leaves, which could symbolize immortality. To the north and south, at the level of the man's gaze, there are <a href="#warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_bronze_bas-reliefs">two bronze bas-reliefs</a>. Under the iron crown, on the supporting column, to the south and to the north, there are two identical distinctive elements, rounded pentagonal shape, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscione">biscione</a>, the heraldic symbol which is one of the symbols of Milan, and another engraving. The wall structure of the monument is surrounded by a flower bed, enclosed by pylons supporting chains, in which there are <a href="warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_tombstones_with_the_names_of_the_fallen">two tombstones with the names of the fallen Musocco's soldiers</a>, positioned under the two bas-reliefs. On a bronze plaque is written <i>Ugo Prat</i>, probably the artist who created some of the sculptures.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial_of_Musocco'>War Memorial of Musocco</a> is symmetrical, elegant and of good artistic value, in art deco style that distinguishes it from the classical heaviness of many other monuments to the fallen. It can be observed especially in the actually sumptuous clothing of the two women and in the posture of the bent and raised arm.</p>

<p>The area surrounding the monument is not valued by the city of Milan, as well as the square. The sidewalk is anonymous, even worse than the others on the outskirts of the city already ugly, the asphalt is a dirty gray color, with bulges and tire marks, the edge is rough. Another flaw is that this site no reflects the circular shape of the square, and extends in some way according to the tram tracks. Last but not least, this precise place of memory, wanted by the Musocchesi to commemorate their loved ones and acquaintances dead fighting in the 1915-1918 War or for their injuries, is not accessible to the visitor without being forced to make an infringement because there are no pedestrian crossing.</p>

<p>The two main elements of the <b>World War I Memorial of Musocco</b> are the two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble">marble</a> statues of female figures, both for their size, about 3 meters high and raised from the ground above the height of man, and for symbolism.</p>

<p>A statue of a woman is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_turrita">Italia turrita</a>, the national personification of Italy, portrayed in an attitude of pain. In fact, the statue facing east, in the direction of Via Giovanni Battista De Rossi, is dressed in a long sumptuous dress and with a cloak over it, her head is covered by a tower, which looks like a helmet, from which braided hair descends, in her right hand she holds a rod or a beam that rests on the ground. The left arm is raised with the hand that touches the head, as a sign of pain for the fallen and that reflects the feeling of the family and the community. For the personification this statue is called <i>Italia</i>, that is Italy. On the plaque that holds it is written on two lines in capital letters: <em>Musocco ai suoi gloriosi caduti</em>, in English Musocco to its glorious fallen.<br>
	The other statue is also a woman, similar to the first sculpture, dressed in a long tunic and a cloak over it, with a pitiful face and performing the same act of pain, with the left arm bent and the hand on the head. This statue, facing west in the direction of Via Bernardino Galliari, holds a book in her right hand, which it wrote <i>Storia</i> (History), and so it is called. The statue rests on a marble plaque, where two dates are indicated in Roman numerals, the start date and the end date of the Great War for Italy: <em>XXIV-V-MCMXV</em> and <em>IV-XI-MCMXVIII</em>, 24 May 1915 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollettino_della_Vittoria">4 November 1918</a>.</p>

<p>Two bronze <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief#Low_relief_or_bas-relief">bas-reliefs</a> of black color are the sculptural element, with which, together with the <a href="#warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_female_marble_statues">two statues of woman</a>, the symbolism of the monument to the fallen of Musocco was realized, of pity and respect for the dead soldiers, almost all young. The third fundamental element is constituted by the <a href="warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_tombstones_with_the_names_of_the_fallen">plaques with the names of the fallen</a>, which are found in the enclosed flowerbed of the memorial under the two bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs are facing Viale Carlo Espinasse, north side and south side of the monument, at a height that facilitates the vision and leads to a time of recollection. Both are inspired by the Christian religion, which has a mediation function, one is a religious celebration, the other is the death of a soldier.</p>

<p>In the bas-relief of the north side of the monument, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)">mass</a> is celebrated, captured when the officiant, facing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altar">altar</a>, elevates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist">Eucharist</a>. A gathering of soldiers in uniform and with a helmet attends the religious ceremony, which commemorates the sacrifice of one or more fallen for the homeland. The soldiers in the foreground are represented from the shoulders and sideways, while, near the altar and more distant, a crowd of people attends the ceremony. These are the expression of the participation and closeness of the people to the duty dangerously done by the soldiers. Mass is outdoors, in fact a tree is behind the altar.</p>

<p>In the bronze bas-relief of the southern side of the monument to the fallen of Musocco, in the direction of Piazzale Accursio, a soldier in relief sitting on the ground, wounded and probably dying, turns to seek relief with his left arm extended and the hand open towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Christ</a>, who radiates him with light, symbol of eternal salvation. Behind the human figure in relief there are trees. On the ground, under Jesus, lies a fallen man, he too under the field of light rays.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">The two tombstones with the names of the fallen</h2>
</div>
<p>The names of the fallen soldiers is the great innovative element of the monuments to the fallen of the First World War, generally written in the form of a list in one or more tombstones. This operation transforms the memorials of war until then celebratory into funerary, even without the presence of the bodies of the fallen. They become places of memory of soldiers who gave their lives for the defense of the homeland. The fallen are identified with name and surname, date of birth and death, or alternatively the age of death, if not even a photo in military uniform. The names are listed in alphabetical order, creating equality in the face of death, which does not fail even when there is the rank in the army.</p>

<p>Musocco's soldiers who fell during the Great War are listed in alphabetical order in two white marble tablets tilted in the grass of the flowerbed surrounding the masonry structure of the memorial, where beautiful rose plants grow. The two tombstones are under the <a href="#warmemorialofMusocco#the_two_bronze_bas-reliefs">two bas-reliefs</a>, north and south side of the monument, position that establishes a relationship with the religious message of the two scenes. Each fallen is identified by surname and name, date of birth and death. The dead are so numerous that each tombstone has three columns.</p>

<p>On the first plaque 84 names are written and in the second 83. Altogether, War Memorial of Musocco commemorates 167 soldiers who died in the First World War for Italy. Twenty-four fell in 1915, five in 1916, fifty-one in 1917, fifty-two in 1918 and four in 1919</p>

<p>Finding the names of the fallen written was the thing that surprised me most and exalted when I carefully visited the War Memorial of Musocco way back in 2012. Similarly, the biggest thrill of this writing was to list those surnames, which sounded familiar to me. In fact, classmates, people from Quarto Oggiaro where I grew up, inhabitants of my house and of Via Barnaba Oriani are homonymous, and perhaps grandchildren, of the fallen in the war, and so were some of my father's colleagues, who had worked at IVI, Industrie Vernici Italiane, at Bovisetta, between the two railway stations.</p>

	<h2 class="content">The fallen of Musocco in the Albo d'Oro of the Fallen and Missing of the 1st World War</h2> 
</div>
<p>The <i>Albo d'Oro</i> (Honor Roll) of the Italians fallen in the world war is a twenty-eight volume document, officially published starting from 6 June 1926 by the Ministry of War in compliance with the Royal Decree n. 2130 of 22 November 1925.<my-ref>^</my-ref> They contain 529,025 names of Italians who died of causes directly attributable to the First World War. This is a partial list: already in 1925, in the same governmental framework, the estimate of the fallen "by direct and well-established cause of war" was 652,000, while 750,000 were counted including the dead "for reasons of war". Today the sheets of these books are digitized and the information of the fallen are in a database of the Ministry of Defense,<my-ref>^</my-ref> which can also be consulted through some websites sponsored by the ministry. The data of each fallen are: name, paternity, date and place of birth, grade, corps, date and place of death, cause of death, decorations.</p>

<p>Palma Antonio Barbalinardo in his recent book Fragments of history of the fallen of Musocco and surroundings of the First World War 1915-1918,<my-ref>^</my-ref> has copied, from the Caduti della Grande Guerra website,<my-ref>^</my-ref> the information of every fallen that appears in the War Memorial of Musocco.<br>
	From this interesting research it emerges that many of the fallen of the War Memorial of Musocco were born in the municipality of Musocco, others in the surrounding municipalities, such as Milan, Trenno, Bollate, Novate Milanese or more generally in Lombardy. Thus in the world war died Bianchi, Brambilla, Brioschi, Casati, Figini, Fossati, Fumagalli, Galbiati, Ghezzi, Mariani, Pedretti, Perego, Tagliabue, Viganò, Villa, just to name a few, which are typically Milanese surnames. Most had the rank of soldier, there were corporals and two sergeants. The most numerous were in the infantry regiment, then bersaglieri, artillerymen, machine-gunners, Fossati Geronzio was a corporal of aeronautics. The glorious fallen of Musocco fought against the Austro-Hungarian army in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_the_Isonzo">12 battles of the Isonzo</a>, from 24 May 1915, the beginning of the great war for Italy, until the battle of Caporetto (24 October-7 November 1917), ended with the famous defeat, dying to conquer a few meters of land and rock in the Karst mountains, Monte San Gabriele, Monte San Michele, Monte Nero, Monte Altissimo. Four of the 167 mentioned in the War Memorial of Musocco have died on other fronts, Albania, Macedonia and Libya. And then on the Asiago altopiano, Monte Grappa, Monte Pasubio, on the Piave, in a war that will end with the victorious entry of the Italian army in Trento, on 3 November 1918. Some died in the field hospital due to injuries sustained in combat, due to illness, in Milan, following poison gas actions, two under an avalanche.</p>

<p>My commitment to the writing of this page and make known the monument to the fallen of Musocco takes place about a hundred years after the tragic events of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">World War I</a> which led to many deaths in the houses of the Europeans, Italians, and inhabitant of Lombardy, Milan and Musocco. The names of the dead carved in the two tombstones, the wounded, the suffering of war have changed the feel and experience of the Europeans, who have understood the lesson of no more wars on European soil after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">Second War</a> even more terrible.<br />
	The urgency and effort for the maintenance of peace trying to understand, reduce, and in some cases remove the possible causes of any conflict of origin is one of the main purposes of the policy of each state. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy">Constitution of the</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Italy"> Italian Republic</a> was born after the conflict of the Second World War and the conflict has had a great influence on his writing, where Article 11<my-ref>^</my-ref> states that<em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a> repudiates war as an instrument of aggression against the freedom of other peoples and as a means of settling international disputes. Agrees, on conditions of equality with other states, to the limitations of sovereignty necessary for an orde that ensures peace and justice among Nations; promotes and encourages international organizations having such ends</em>.<br />
	There are many commemorations of those days that take place in Europe, especially in France, Belgium, England, a little less in Italy. The town of Musocco and Milan had understood the importance of remembering the war and the dead of the First World War with a large monument of good artistic value in the square in front of the building in their community.</p>

<p>I wrote the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial_of_Musocco">War Memorial of Musocco</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> in reduced form. The same page wrote in <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagina_principale">Wikipedia Italy</a> was <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Speciale:Registri&amp;page=Monumento_ai_caduti_di_Musocco">deleted</a> with internal cancellation procedure after short <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pagine_da_cancellare/Monumento_ai_caduti_di_Musocco">debate</a>. I dedicated a <a href='#eliminazioneMonumentoaicadutidiMusoccosuWikipedia'>page</a> about this with all details, in italian only. I recap in this section the deletion request by a wikipedia administrator and my overall conclusion about the italian page cancellation.</p>
<p>Italian Wikipeda administrator: As in {{<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:E" title="Template:E">E</a>}} I entered: at present is not clear from the voice that what characterizes this monument in a particular way, so as to distinguish it from the thousands of others present in the world. Precise: only in Italy there is at least one in each municipality (this is common in the former, now district of Milan). I should add that I have already removed, for obvious non-encyclopedic, the complete list of the fallen listed on the monument itself..&nbsp; --<a class="new" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Utente:Castagna&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Utente:Castagna (la pagina non esiste)">Castagna</a><a class="new" href="http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Utente:Castagna&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Utente:Castagna (la pagina non esiste)"></a> 01:42, July, 7th 2013 (CEST). Follow the debate with myself and the response of other administrators.</p>
<p>My current conclusion: in fact, the deletion of the page War Memorial of Musocco on Wikipedia Italy, in italian Monumento ai caduti di Musocco, revolves around the reputation of the monument or its artistic value, or both. Weighs the judgment of a single administrator. A description of the page would be accepted in the page that talks about the town of Musocco, and here I will not go into other topics, but not as a stand-alone page. I&#39;m just saying that the internet is a set of linked page. <br />
	On the reputation of the monument, well a building 10 meters high which forces a change in the road network, which requires costly restoration, which is seen by thousands of people who go around every day, which commemorates the hundreds of dead from the First World War, of which among other occurs the centennial and now see in Europe manifestations reminiscent of that tragic event, which is an artist who has been to synthesize the pain of home to the soldiers who died and to give a religious significance, that...</p>

		<p>...in Piazzale Santorre of Santarosa, where you can admire the War Memorial by sculptor U. Prat, who was thus designed: a high plinth holding two marble stele that occur surmounted by a crown of wrought iron. Two marble statues on either side, they want to represent Italy and History. Below you can admire the bas-reliefs in bronze: a soldier falls in sacrifice to winning Italy and a gathering of religious soldiers accompanying the sacrifice of a Mass at the camp. All in a frame to remind Unknown sacrificial martyrs of the homeland.</p>
