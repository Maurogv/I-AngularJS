    <h2>Meeting with the poet</h2>
</div>
<p>As a young man I liked to read books of fiction and poetry, many authors made ​​reference cited, paying homage always to the same great poet. Aware that hardly great writers and poets could be wrong, I delayed the reading of the great poet to stay still in the shadow of the other authors
    to deepen him further. Dante had studied in school, but I did not remember anything, maybe I was not even impressed. I am reminded of those great writers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky">Dostoyevsky</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Montale">Montale</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giosuè_Carducci">Carducci</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Foscolo">Foscolo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Gadda">Gadda</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Porta">Porta</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Leopardi">Leopardi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Manzoni">Manzoni</a>.
    I remember that Giacomo Leopardi wrote in the <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/best-poems/count-giacomo-leopardi/on-dante-s-monument-1818/"> Canti II On the Monument of Dante</a>, <em>the one for which the meonio cantor is not alone</em> just comparing Dante to the Meonia poet, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer</a>, or of Alessandro Manzoni that says <em>to wash clothes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno">Arno</a></em> before the final 
    draft of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Betrothed_(Manzoni_novel)">Betrothed novel</a>.</p>
<p>My knowledge of Dante began with the reading of his early works, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_vulgari_eloquentia">De Vulgari eloquentia</a>, written in Latin and read in Italian, in which he claimed the dignity of the vernacular, Convivio, then the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy">Comedy</a> ...</p>

    <h2>Convivio</h2>
</div>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convivio">Convivio</a>, impressed me, a book different from any I had read until then, those beginnings are surprising for their beauty and then hold the promise. </p>
<p><em>As the Philosopher says at the beginning of the First Philosophy, all men by nature desire to know. The reason for this can be and is that each thing, impelled by a force provided by its own nature, inclines towards its own perfection. Since knowledge is the ultimate perfection of our soul, in which resides our ultimate happiness, we are all therefore by nature subject to a desire for it.</em><my-ref></my-ref><br />
    As the Philosopher (par excellence) says, Aristotle, at the beginning of his Metaphysics, all men naturally desire to know. The reason for this desire to know is that all things, in whose nature is painted in divine providence, is inclined to its perfection, this providence, so as the science
    is the ultimate perfection of our soul, which is the our ultimate happiness, naturally, all are subject to this desire</p>
<p><em>Many are, however, deprived of this most noble perfection by various causes within and outside of man which remove him from the habit of knowledge.<br />
    </em>However, this noble perfection, the natural desire to know of men, many are private to various causes, within or outside of man, which prevent him to get to the science.<br />
    Dante identifies two defects that are excusable for not arrive at perfection, body defects, deafness, muteness or similar (within of man) and the civil and family care that prevents the possibility of studying (outside of man). Others do not reach the perfection of the soul for their own are not excusable, that malice has to follow vicious pleasures (within) and laziness that does not go away those who are born in places without study facilities (outside); the first, malice, which is more worthy of blame and abomination.</p>
<p>This far Dante, one side has indicated the happiness of everything as natural that follows its own perfection, the other finds the causes that many away from this condition. For subtraction says<em>:</em><em><br />
    Blessed are the few who sit at the table where the bread of the angels is eaten, and most unfortunate those who share the food of sheep!.<br />
    </em>Oh, blessed are those few, true scholars, who can sit at the table in which it feeds on the divine wisdom (and human)! poor and those who share the same food with sheep<em>!</em></p>
<p><em>But since man is by nature a friend of all men, and every friend is grieved by defects found in the one he loves, they who are fed at so lofty a table are not without compassion toward those whom they see grazing about on grass and acorns in animal pastures.<br />
    </em>But as each man to another man is by nature a friend, and every friend complains of what is missing from the one he loves (his friend), those who are fed in such high table (the bread of angels, the divine wisdom) with mercy see who graze like beast
    eating grass and acorns (see those who live in ignorance).<br />
    <em>And since compassion is the mother of generosity, they who possess knowledge always give liberally of their great riches to the truly poor and are like a living fountain by whose waters the natural thirst referred to above is quenched.<br />
    </em>As mercy (pity), is the source of good deed, those who know (the few who have access to the table) liberally donate their good riches over real poor (those excluded from the table) and are almost a source of life, of which water quenches natural thirst
    (thirst for knowledge) named above<em>.</em></p>
<p>Convivio is a work of doctrine, is an argumentative text. Who knows the real happiness want all can participate it.<br />
    <em>Therefore I, who do not sit at the blessed table, but, having fled the pasture of the common herd, gather up a part of what falls to the feet of those who do sit there, and who know the unfortunate life of those I have left behind, for the sweetness that I taste in what I gather up piece by piece, and moved by compassion, though not forgetting myself, have set aside for those who are unfortunate something that I placed before their eyes some time ago, by which I have increased their desire.<br />
    </em>And I, who do not sit at the table blessed (the wisdom), but escaped from ignorance, at the feet of those who sit in what I take from them falls, and I know the miserable lives of those I left behind, for the sweetness that I feel of what I take little by little, moved by
    mercy, I will not forget (them), I have reserved for the poor some things, which in their eyes, for some time, I have shown; and in this I made them more eager<em>.<br />
    </em>Dante, scholar of the wise, escaped from the pasture of the common people provides commentary, the bread, to its songs, the food. Dante in the Convivio comment on their songs that had already been published and known, so that they can be enjoyed by the poor as not to leave friends behind him<em>.</em></p>

<div class="page-header">
    <h2>Commedia</h2>
</div>
<p>The Comedy is a song that begins with the pilgrim Dante, the author of the book, overwhelmed by sin, which is the single individual in the history of mankind. The sinner finds comfort in the teacher who had taught the poem, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Virgil</a>, who offers himself as a guide to lead him in the journey 
    through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)">Hell</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatorio">Purgatory</a> to let him to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Portinari">Beatrice</a>, loved by the poet in his youth and then died young, the Grace that brings to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradiso_(Dante)">Heaven</a>, Beatrice latest in a chain of women running from Maria. The power of Dante, his high fantasy,
    exhausted in the effort to the vision of Christ incarnate, the mystery of humanity. The last verse of the Comedy, <em>the love that moves the sun and the other stars</em> we will return to the first, <em>in the middle of the journey of our life</em>, in the circularity of the poem, the melody of a song without end.<br />
    </p>
<p>Dante describes in his Convivio as the dish, his songs, are to be tasted, introducing a broader speech in which he explains the different senses that you can find in a writing. This lesson<my-ref>ref</my-ref> can be applied also to the way in which the Commedia should be read in order to grasp its meaning, or at least a part of it.<br />
    <em>In order that this food of mine may be more beneficial, I wish to show, how the first course should be eaten.</em><br />
    Because of greater benefit (more useful because better understood) this is my food, before the first course (the first song of Convivio), I want to show you how you should eat, or out of metaphor Dante wishes to illustrate how to be read and commented on the text.</p>
<p><em>It is needful to know that writing can be understood and should be expounded in four main ways.</em><br />
    You should know that in a text can be understood and can be explained up to four senses.<em><br />
    The first is termed the literal, and this is the meaning that, in poetic fables for instance, does not delve beneath the surface of the words. The next is termed the allegorical, and this meaning is concealed beneath the cloak of the fables, and is a truth hidden beneath a lovely fiction. </em>The first way is called the literal, and this is the one that extends beyond the letters of the words that express the apparent sense, the other is called allegorical, and this is what lies beneath these tales (outward 
    appearance), and is a truth hidden beneath a beautiful lie.<br />
    <em>The third meaning is the moral one, and this is the meaning that teachers should seek to uncover throughout the scriptures, for their own and their pupils’ benefit. </em>The third sense is called moral, and this is what readers have to look carefully in the Scriptures, to their utility and their disceples (pupils). <br />
    <em>The fourth meaning is termed anagogical, that is to say beyond the senses, </em>a spiritual meaning that overlaps with the literal, the literal text though true to what he says is to represent the eternal glory of the <em>supernal</em> things (divine).</p>
<p>In that order you must search for plans of a text and in Comedy?<br />
    <em>In this kind of explanation, the literal should always be treated first, as being the meaning in which the others are enclosed, and without which it would be impossible and illogical to treat the other meanings, especially the allegorical. It would be impossible because with regard to all that has an outside and an inside, it is impossible to arrive at the inside without first arriving at the outside; thus, given that, in what is written, the outside is always the literal meaning, it is impossible to arrive at the other meanings, especially the allegorical, without first arriving at the literal<br /></em>
    The literal meaning must always be seen and heard for the first, like the one in whose statement are enclosed in the other, and without which it would be impossible and irrational to understand others, first of all the allegorical. It&#39;s impossible for a thing that has a meaning internal, hidden, and one outside, instantly recognizable, get (understand) the internal meaning without having understood external; then, with the fact that the writings (the plane literal) is always the outer part, it is impossible to come to the other, mainly in the allegorical, without first come (understand) the literal.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to deepen the Comedy, I&#39;ll <em>&#39;use&#39;</em> it when I will have some flash in the drafting of this site, verses that always accompanied me in my adult life, as ill, the one who is sick or hurt, as walker, runner, explorer, by those who wish not to be removed 
    from the banquet of truth. The triplets will be examined within the meaning of Comedy and context in which they are mentioned by me.</p>

    <h2>Inferno II 4-6: ... which my unerring memory shall retrace</h2>
</div>
<p><em>prepared myself the war to sustain,<br />
    both of the way and the pity,<br />
    which my unerring memory shall retrace.</em></p>
<p>Dante fallen into sin and ended up in the darkness of hell, after finding comfort in Virgil who offers to guide him (Inferno I), is aware of the hard trail&nbsp;(the war) who will have to face, physical (the way) and morality, compassionan (the pity) to the punishment of the damned, entrusting to his memory infallible the remembrance of what he will live to tell the tale. In the same way my memory that is not wrong shows the path of examinations, words, pauses, gestures, organization that lead to a diagnosis and its treatment in hospitals, doctors&#39; surgeries, dentists and
    that heard in the life of every day, then tell the tale.</p>
