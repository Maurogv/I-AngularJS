<p>The site was born from the desire and need to tell my story after a fall illustrating the numerous attempts to understand the origin of pain, the care, the trend of health conditions, the relationship with physicians and institutions, the vicissitudes. Provides elements of my training and my human passions that 
    may be of understanding the whole story, while a section describing places known to me. You read <a href="#preamble">preamble</a>.</p>
<p>The section of the story after the fall remembers the moments considered most important of requests for treatment and the answers that were provided, the documents in the possession, following strictly the cronology of events, succeeding by remarks, comments and opinions, it is a page of the complaint.<br />
    Prevailing narrative and information, followed by my analysis that has more argumentative character, follows a logical, reasoning to arrive at a sensible conclusion in order to convince the reader. The informative text is often scientific, proceeds by definition, sets one, then proceed considering it a back for a second, to continue to progress in the information.<br />
    In the section on places prevails descriptive text with the aim of representing the object, which is a pragmatic text, such as the story, wanting to get a practical purpose, while the text is more literary when I quote maestroes or I have flashbacks about their teachings or analogies.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks are very used to the narrative and descriptive. Links that are directed to my site or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> will point directly within the narrative, for all the other it adds a reference to the notes of the page and from there you address them. This solution was adopted because the reader can immediately distinguish the most frequent source
    from other. Wikipedia is the online encyclopedia, which everyone can contribute and improve each page, has the advantage of having a large number of items, a great knowledge of the human, with the pages of a good standard and
    articulated and others that are just the beginning of an argument and to check, in italian some entries are mediocre, contain errors and are misleading; in any case all the pages have the origin from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">guidelines</a> set by encyclopedia.<br />
    For a more in-depth analysis of each item, free and varied, please you refer to page on internet, detectable by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine">web search engines</a> as Google<my-ref>^</my-ref>, sites, books, movies, knowledge and personal experience.</p>
<p>Every page has a title, a subtitle that gives a definition or a brief explanation of the page, the page index, the body of the page with paragraphs in which it is articulate, in the end notes, list of hyperlinks and photos <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domains</a>, bibliography if it exists, date of page last modification. Page index and list of page domains are identifiable by a colored line at the top. In the index the link to notes is separated from the last title paragraph by an empty line.<br />
    An original text that is copied is in italics, as the titles of books and chapters of reference in the notes.</p>
<p>The site has two languages, Italian and English, not always the same page exists in two versions and the translation is not always literal. For the translation from Italian to English in addition to my basic knowledge of English was used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate">Google Translate</a><my-ref>^</my-ref>, sometimes with the further 
    help of WordReference<my-ref>^</my-ref>.</p>
<p>The platform used is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">AngularJS</a><my-ref>^</my-ref>, the powerful and innovative MVW Javascript framework for writing applications by Google getting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Application</a>. AngularJS lets extend HTMLâ€™s syntax, automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding and teaches the browser how to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">inversion of control</a>.<br> 
The programming model is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-View-Controller">MVC</a> made even more powerful (C that becomes W, Whatever) with the addition to the controller of components and services written as a client.<br>
    The page style, css, is bootstrap<my-ref>^</my-ref> which facilitates and improves readability and layout of the site. <br />
    The code executed in the client side, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, has these functions:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>create the table of contents</li>
     <li>fill out the reference linking to the source in the notes</li>
     <li>list the links domains</li>
     <li>list the photos domains</li>
     <li>add links to social and email, in which it used the javascript code provided by addthis<my-ref>^</my-ref></li>   
    </ul>
<p>Hyperlinks that do not address the site or Wikipedia have an additional symbol. The site has a small library of 16x16 graphic symbols of the sites to which you refer; if the symbol is existing in my library is added in front of the hyperlink, otherwise the external connection 
    is highlighted with a standard symbol <img src='{{languageInvariantStrings.externalHyperlinkIcon}}' alt="Graphic symbol of external hyperlink" /> after link. The library was built with search icons by Google Search with the site name and image of the size 16x16. If the brand icon of the site is available as a resource on the Internet is added to the library.<br />
    The link is highlighted when the mouse is over.</p>
