<p>The site was born from the will and need to tell my story after a fall and the vicissitudes providing elements of my personal and professional formation, but also deals with other topics of my liking the history and description of places that I have known.</p>
<p>The section that relates the story of a medical nature after the fall is written as a story set in a global context, with objective evidence, the documents in the 
   possession, followed by remarks, comments and opinions, it is a page of the complaint.<br />
   Prevailing narrative and information, followed by my analysis at that time or current one that has more argumentative character, follows a logical, reasoning to arrive at a sensible conclusion in order to convince the reader. The informative text is often scientific, proceeds by definition, sets one, then proceed considering it a back for a second, to continue to progress in the information. Where the documentation was not kept or non-existent or that arises from the experience of the situation and exchange in the medical report, structure, patient I ask to my <a href='#en-dante#inferno_ii_4-6:_..._which_my_unerring_memory_shall_retrace'>memory</a>.<br />In the section on places prevails descriptive text with the aim of representing the object, which is a pragmatic text as the first, the story triggered by the fall, because they want to get a practical purpose, while the text is more literary when I quote maestroes or I have flashbacks about their teachings or analogies.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks are very used to the narrative and descriptive, frequently addressed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, the online encyclopedia. I realize that adding many links on a page sometimes complicate his reading and direct them to the same platform means reaching the same source. Wikipedia, which everyone can contribute and improve each page, it has the advantage of having a large number of items, a great knowledge of the human, with the pages of a good standard and
    articulated and others that are just the beginning of an argument and to check; in any case all the pages have the origin from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">guidelines</a> set by encyclopedia. Please refer to each item a more in-depth analysis of their own, free and various through search engines on the internet, almost always <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl">Google</a>, sites, books, movies, knowledge and personal experience.</p>
<p>Every page has a title, a subtitle number that gives a definition or a brief explanation of the page, follow the cards (sometimes they are at the bottom) identifiable by a colored line at the top, containing the page index, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domains</a> of links and photos; then the body of the page with the sections in which it is articulated, in the end notes and bibliography, date of last modification of the page.<br />
    An original text that is copied is in italics, as the titles of books and chapters of reference in the notes.</p>
<p>The site has two languages, Italian and English, not always the same page exists in two versions and the translation is not always literal. For the translation from Italian to English in addition to my basic knowledge of English was used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate">Google Translate</a>, sometimes with the further 
    help of <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/it/">Wordreference</a>.</p>
<p>The site is written with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">angularjs</a>, the Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework, made up by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google'>Google</a>, that let HTML as template language and let you the syntax in a declarative way. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding.
    AngularJS teaches the browser how to do <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection'>dependency injection</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control'>inversion of control</a>.<br />MVW is a programming model that evolves from the Model View Controller (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-View-Controller">MVC</a>), with W as whatever, anything, to show that the glue between data and view goes beyond the controller thanks to the definition of components. <br />  
    The used front-end style, css, is bootstrap which facilitates and improves readability and layout of the site.  <br />
    The code executed in the client side, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, is heavily used to build:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the index of the page </li>
    <li>notes that refer to the source </li>
    <li>list the domains of text links </li>
    <li>list the domains of the links photos </li>
    <li>links to social and email, in which you use the javascript code provided by addthis</li>   
</ul>
<p>The link of the page you are directed to the domain most frequently, the first in the list of domains, is simply highlited, others have an additional symbol at the end of the link, if any graph in the list of 
  mapped with the logo of the company, or reported with a symbol that indicates external link. When the mouse is on the link, this is underlined.</p>
