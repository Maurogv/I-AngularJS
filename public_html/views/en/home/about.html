<p>The site was born from the desire and need to tell my story after a fall illustrating the numerous attempts to understand its consequences and the internal origin of pain, the care, the trend of health conditions, the relationship with physicians and institutions, hospitals, my vicissitudes. Provides elements of my training and find my passions, that may be of understanding for the whole story. You read <a href="#preamble">preamble</a>, which often it's convenient in each good work.</p>
<p>The story begins with <a href="#thefall">the fall</a>, remembers the moments considered most important of requests for treatment and the answers that were provided, the documents in my possession, following strictly the cronology of events, succeeding by remarks, comments and opinions, it is a page of complaint.<br />
    The text of the story is a text pragmatic because it wants to get a practical purpose which combines narration and information, followed by my analysis. The narrative text tells the fact that takes place over time with myself starring, while information enriches the reader&#39;s knowledge on the problem by putting the data available to me, becoming sometimes technical, scientific proceeding by definition, fix one, then proceeds deeming a support for a second, to continue to progress in information. The analysis of the facts has an argumentive character, follows a logical, reasoning to arrive at a sensible conclusion in order to persuade and convince the reader, it can become rhetorical because it says things new and big.</p>
<p>A large important section is dedicated to my training, my reading and study of Dante, often inspiring, I told as <a href="#mymeetingwiththepoet">born</a> my passion and I have paraphrased a part of <a href="#introductiontoConvivio">Convivio</a>, considered useful exercise to good writing and successful story. When I have any flashbacks I <a href="#myquotesontheComedy">mention</a> the Comedy.</p>
<p>The site has two languages, Italian and English, not always the same page exists in two versions and the translation is not always literal. For the translation from Italian to English in addition to my basic knowledge of English was used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate">Google Translate</a><my-ref>^</my-ref>, which helps among other things to recognize and then eliminate syntax errors in the language to be translated, that is Italian, sometimes with the further help of WordReference<my-ref>^</my-ref>.<br />
    The English language spreads it around the world, what is not understood or known in a language, or will not be, it may be from those who speak another one while saying the same things, moreover the audience is wider.<br />
    If the job of translating into English was expensive, not least the outcome was amazing. Big improvements in form and content have taken place at the time of translation, which forces to look at again and also simplify the above, returning back to English and to a second review in Italian, my overall work without a second language would have been far lower.<br />
    My English and my Italian improved with these tests; nevertherless you will notice many errors in sentence structure or in its flow, conjunctions, adverbs, uncommon mode to say things, verbs, verb tenses, and their position, easily corrected or be simplified by those who speak it fluently, denoting my origin.<br />
    Returning to the poet, English is the vernacular that succeeds as a new sun to light.<br />

<p>Hyperlinks are very used to the narrative and descriptive. Links that are directed to my site or to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> will point directly within the narrative, for all the other it adds a reference to the notes of the page and from there you address them. This solution was adopted because the reader can immediately distinguish the most frequent source from other.<br />  
    Wikipedia is the online encyclopedia, which everyone can contribute and improve each page, has the advantage of having a large number of items, a great knowledge of the human, with the pages of a good standard and articulated and others that are just the beginning of an argument and to check, in italian some entries are mediocre, contain errors and are misleading; in any case all the pages have the origin from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">guidelines</a> set by encyclopedia.<br />
    For a more in-depth analysis of each item, free and varied, please you refer to page on internet, detectable by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine">web search engines</a> as Google<my-ref>^</my-ref>, sites, books, movies, knowledge and personal experience.</p>
<p>Every page has a title, a subtitle that gives a definition or a brief explanation of the page, the page index, the body of the page with paragraphs in which it is articulate, in the end notes, list of hyperlinks and photos <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domains</a>, bibliography if it exists, date of page last modification. Page index and list of page domains are identifiable by a colored line at the top. In the index the link to notes is separated from the last title paragraph by an empty line.<br />
    An original text that is copied is in italics, as the titles of books and chapters of reference in the notes.</p>
<p>The platform used is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">AngularJS</a><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref>, the powerful and innovative MVW Javascript framework for writing applications by Google getting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Application</a>. AngularJS lets extend HTML’s syntax, automatically synchronizes data from UI (view) with JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding and teaches the browser how to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">inversion of control</a>.<br> 
    MVW (Model-View-Whatever)<my-ref>^</my-ref> is an evolution of the programming model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-View-Controller">MVC</a>. The Model-View-Controller (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller">MVC</a><my-ref>^</my-ref>) architectural pattern separates an application into three main components: the model (M), the view (V), and the controller (C) providing loose coupling between different aspects of the application, input logic, business logic, and User Interface (UI) logic. It enables to focus on one aspect of the implementation at a time as separation of concerns. 
    Over time and thanks to many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactorings</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">api</a> improvements, AngularJS is now closer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">MVVM</a>, the $scope object could be considered the ViewModel that is being decorated by a function (Controller). This framework flexibility has been named as whatever (W), whatever works for you.<br />
    The language of the style sheets, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> that gives the appearance and formatting of the page, is Bootstrap<my-ref>^</my-ref>, that facilitates and improves readability and layout of the site.<br />
    A work has been spent on the double language of the site with a certain degree of difficulty in routing and in the definition of controller.<br />
    The code executed in the client side, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, has these functions:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>create the table of contents</li>
     <li>fill out the reference linking to the source in the notes</li>
     <li>back to top</li>
     <li>list the links domains</li>
     <li>list the photos domains</li>
     <li>add links to social and email, in which it used the javascript code provided by addthis<my-ref>^</my-ref></li>   
    </ul>
<p>Hyperlinks that do not address the site or Wikipedia have an additional symbol. The site has a small library of 16x16 graphic symbols of the sites to which you refer; if the symbol is existing in my library is added in front of the hyperlink, otherwise the external connection is highlighted with a standard symbol <img src='{{languageInvariantStrings.externalHyperlinkIcon}}' alt="Graphic symbol of external hyperlink" /> after link. The library was built with search icons by Google Search with the site name and image of the size 16x16. If the brand icon of the site is available as a resource on the Internet is added to the library.<br />
    The link is highlighted when the mouse is over.</p>
