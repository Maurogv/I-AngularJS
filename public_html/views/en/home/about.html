<p>The site was born from the desire and need to tell my story after a fall illustrating the numerous attempts to understand the origin of pain, the care, the trend of health conditions, the relationship with physicians and institutions, the vicissitudes. Provides elements of my training and my human passions that 
    may be of understanding the whole story, while a section describing places known to me. You read <a href="#preamble">preamble</a>.</p>
<p>The section of the story after the fall remembers the moments considered most important of requests for treatment and the answers that were provided, the documents in the possession, followed by remarks, comments and opinions, it is a page of the complaint.<br />
    Prevailing narrative and information, followed by my analysis that has more argumentative character, follows a logical, reasoning to arrive at a sensible conclusion in order to convince the reader. The informative text is often scientific, proceeds by definition, sets one, then proceed considering it a back for a second, to continue to progress in the information. <br />In the section on places prevails descriptive text with the aim of representing the object, which is a pragmatic text, such as the
    story, wanting to get a practical purpose, while the text is more literary when I quote maestroes or I have flashbacks about their teachings or analogies.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks are very used to the narrative and descriptive, frequently addressed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, the online encyclopedia. I realize that adding many links on a page sometimes complicate his reading and direct them to the same platform means reaching the same source. Wikipedia, which everyone can contribute and improve each page, it has the advantage of having a large number of items, a great knowledge of the human, with the pages of a good standard and
    articulated and others that are just the beginning of an argument and to check; in any case all the pages have the origin from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">guidelines</a> set by encyclopedia. Please refer to each item a more in-depth analysis of their own, free and various through search engines on the internet, almost always <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl">Google</a>, sites, books, movies, knowledge and personal experience.</p>
<p>Every page has a title, a subtitle number that gives a definition or a brief explanation of the page, follow the cards (sometimes they are at the bottom) identifiable by a colored line at the top, containing the page index, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domains</a> of links and photos; then the body of the page with the sections in which it is articulated, in the end notes and bibliography, date of last modification of the page.<br />
    An original text that is copied is in italics, as the titles of books and chapters of reference in the notes.</p>
<p>The site has two languages, Italian and English, not always the same page exists in two versions and the translation is not always literal. For the translation from Italian to English in addition to my basic knowledge of English was used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate">Google Translate</a>, sometimes with the further 
    help of <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/it/">Wordreference</a>.</p>
<p>The site was written with <a href="http://www.asp.net/">Microsoft ASP.NET</a> MVC 5. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET">Active Server Page</a> is a free platform that allows you to build websites with HTML code, cascade style sheets (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">css</a>) and javascript. The processing is done on the server that returns the 
    code. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller">MVC</a> stands for Model View Controller, a programming model to implement the user interface, wherein the controller intercepts the request, it queries the model and passes it to the view, the html code. The language used in the controller is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">c#</a>. To facilitate the writing of the html code using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_Razor_view_engine">Razor view engine</a> that builds it with the syntax of its template.<br />  
    The used front-end style, css, is bootstrap which facilitates and improves readability and layout of the site.  <br />
    The code executed in the client side, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, is heavily used to build:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the index of the page </li>
    <li>notes that refer to the source </li>
    <li>list the domains of text links </li>
    <li>list the domains of the links photos </li>
    <li>links to social and email, in which you use the javascript code provided by addthis</li>   
</ul>
<p>Hyperlink of the page you are directed to the domain most frequently, the first in the list of domains, is simply highlited, others have an additional symbol at the end of the link, if any graph in the list of 
  mapped with the logo of the company, or reported with a symbol that indicates external link. When the mouse is on the link, this is underlined.</p>
