<p>I&#39;ve always been attracted by the computer, since I was given the first personal computer, the Commodore 64. Through a code a machine could perform the planned activities that depended only on the programmer! Naturally I was writing in Basic simple instructions to issues
    of fancy, usually composition of words, ideas and practices that allowed me to compare myself with language comprehension and its verification on the machine. More generally, I liked math, sciences, the ability to compare with a problem with the hope
    to solve it and show it in a comprehensible form. Even the words, as they make up with each other, their sound, the language and the rules that they build, grammar and poetry have always fascinated me and continues to do so.</p>
<p>The network of the Internet, a series of pages linked together, is a source of continuous inspiration, which allows to express themselves freely and form large, true statement if you are able by themselves to manage their own pages. In a site may develop an argument complete, providing information deemed necessary for the understanding
    of the topic. The development of a website is also a good opportunity to touch the technologies or platforms or work plans for its management, which continues to evolve by offering new models and programming paradigms. I also expect to gain something economically.</p>
<p>In Grace I think I have something to say about me, my life journey, difficult, confused, scary, in need of help of others so decided to build this site to tell about it driven by a sense of justice, clarity and salvation. <br />
    The story I tell is linked to the vicissitudes after a fall when I was 18 years old, with the onset of pain that becomes chronic that affects the activities of everyday life. I discusses the attempts to understand the consequences of the fall and the physical origin of this ill, the choices taken to 
    relieve pain and remove the alleged causes, showing in detail the medical route and the result of medical care with attention to the relationship between man, patient, doctor, structure and system. It will emerge transformation, capsizing and distortion of reality, an inability to understand it within structures and system, 
    the ignorance, the number of times of this distortion, elements that led to the direct involvement in the deterioration of health conditions. I extend my analysis to family environment, and that of the city and region and the economic aspect will show in fiction and general hypocrisy.<br />
    On the other hand it will manifest my desire to heal, strength and determination, hope, and the reasoning leading to conclusions and decisions, wait and intelligence, experience and faith that helps us, the need for help and the challenge to deal with these adversities.<br />
    The impact on the daily lives involve all activities, study, work, productive, sports, emotional and spread out on the family, the father, mother, brother. Some consequences are loneliness, the inability to fully exercise a profession, the distance from women or a woman, the reduced or absent social life, friendships that do not appear as such, be insulted in my own disease condition, the risk of poverty.<br />
    The biggest challenge remains the fight against evil, certainty is the love for the truth.</p>
<p>Why you can better know who writes I&#39;ll show my human training that allows me to thank, though never enough, and meet again my maestroes, poets, Dante, writers, Alessandro Manzoni, scientists, Galileo, and remember the Italy. These pages are functional in order to understand the whole story.<br />
    I quote here also the passions that make a person unique, love for the sport, the tennis played before the accident, or the one seen on TV or directly, cycling with its tours that keep company for many months, athletics, football, skiing, other sports and champions from Roger Federer to Eddie Merckx, Usain Bolt and Carl Lewis and all the other. Then the mountain which has replaced the sport, a passion that feeds itself with the beauty of the places and the desire to see beyond, the preparation to be able to go, the running, and photography. Do not forget the reverence for science that rises high, the religion that helps men in difficulty.<br /></p>   
<p>Indeed most of the day in recent years has spent keeping up-to-date on how to program on the internet, sometimes accompanied by listening to classical music, Antonio Vivaldi as a favorite.In the other part of the day I walking, exercise often useful in my condition and taking picutes, photography that comes from the desire to know and testimony, experience that completes the journey in places and I manage it and share. The unique theme
    of my photographs are streets and roads of my neighborhood and the places of my trips. When I take the whole day I dedicate it to the mountains, to travel, to explore, to the unknown, all this in the sustainability of the family.<br />
    The place for me is Lombardy, so the city where I have lived, studied and have been taken care, Milan, my neighborhood, the area of ​​north-west of Milan to the north of the Bridge of Ghisolfa, Musocco, the province of Lecco,
    Valsassina, Barzio, the Grigne, Valleys of Bergamo, Lake of Como, the Canton Ticino, the province of Varese where I was born, in Varese, August 6th 1969. <br />
    Even though I have talked so much of Lombardy and Italy before I don&#39;t forget that all the technology, 
    methodology and programming languages​​, scientific development is born elsewhere the United States and Korea, designed in English.</p>
<p>Last but not least I remember the way in which one tries to win the day, or rather the week, with few resources, following what my father was already done, cultivating the hobby of collecting paper and selling stamps, postcards, telephone cards, figurines, pieces of paper with all kinds of designs, colors, photo. They are light subjects of distraction, that somehow they filled the day.</p>
<p>Let me share this with you.</p>
