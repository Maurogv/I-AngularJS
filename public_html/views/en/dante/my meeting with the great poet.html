<p>As a young man I liked to read, many were books of fiction and poetry. Numerous authors quoted and paid homage to the same poet. Aware that hardly great writers and poets could be wrong, I delayed the reading of the great poet to stay still in the shadow of the other authors, to deepen him further.  They come to mind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky">Dostoyevsky</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Montale">Montale</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiosuÃ¨_Carducci">Carducci</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Foscolo">Foscolo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Gadda">Gadda</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Porta">Porta</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Leopardi">Leopardi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Manzoni">Manzoni</a>. In the second of his Canti, On the Monument of Dante,<my-ref>^</my-ref> Giacomo Leopardi called him <em>the one for which the meonio cantor is not alone</em>, comparing Dante to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer</a>, native of Meonia, author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, the two greatest epic poems of Greek literature; Alessandro Manzoni, before the final draft of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Betrothed_(Manzoni_novel)">Betrothed novel</a>, understands having <em>to wash clothes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno">Arno</a></em>.</p>

<p>I had studied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</a> in secondary school, I remember only a few fragments of discussions during the third year on the Divine Comedy with the Italian teacher of the technical institute, with nothing left. In the first year of college I read Inferno, especially on the way to reach the polytechnic, on tram 33 which took over half an hour to cross Milan; in the evening I memorized the triplets. Wanting to know more about the origin, I read in Italian one of his first works, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_vulgari_eloquentia">De Vulgari eloquentia</a>, written in Latin, in which the Florentine poet upholds the dignity of the vernacular.<br>
	Then, I got to <a href="#introductiontoConvivio">Convivio</a> which surprised me from the beginning for the beauty of the language, the genius, different from all the other books I had read, both in style and in meaning, opening up a new horizon. This book is anticipation and preparation for <a href="#comedy">Comedy</a>.</p>
