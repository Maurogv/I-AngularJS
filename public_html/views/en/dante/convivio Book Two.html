	now listen to the speech within my heart,<br />
	for I cannot speak to others, so strange it seems.</em><br />
	You whose as pure intellects do move the third heaven,<br />
	listen to the talk that is in my heart,<br />
	for I cannot speak to others, so it appears to me extraordinary.<br />
	4. <em>The heaven that moves according to your power<br />
	draws me o noble creatures that you are,<br />
	into the state in which I find myself.</em><br />
	The heaven (Venus) that follows your belongings,<br />
	gentle creatures (noble creatures, as pure intellects and first creatures) that you are,<br />
	leads me in the state where I find myself.<br />
	7. <em>And hence these words about the life I live<br />
	Should properly be told, it seems, to you:<br />
	And so I pray that you will listen to me.<br />
	I shall recount the strangeness in my heart,<br />
	How here within my sad soul weeps,<br />
	And how against her speaks a spirit that comes<br />
	Upon the rays descending from your star.</em><br />
	Hence these words about the life I live,<br />
	Should properly be told, it seems, to you:<br />
	And so I pray that you will listen to me (and understand me as pure intellects).<br />
	I will speak of the new that is in my heart, (the extraordinary event consisting in the presence of two thoughts and the contrast between them)<br />
	how the sad soul weeps in it, (the thought of Beatrice died)<br />
	and how a spirit against her (the sad soul) speaks, (and how a new feeling of love is opposed to crying soul)<br />
	that comes from the rays of your star (Venus).</p>

<p>40. <em>“You are not slain but only led astray,<br />
	Dear soul of ours who so laments,”<br />
	A gentle spirit of love replies to me,<br />
	“For this fair lady whose power you feel<br />
	Has changed your life so very much<br />
	That you are frightened, and become a coward!</em><br />
	"You are not dead, but you only led astray,<br />
	oh our soul who so laments",<br />
	replies to me, a gentle spirit of love, (the thinking for the new woman)<br />
	"for that nice lady, whose power you feel<br />
	has so changed your whole life<br />
	that you are frightened, and become so vile!"<br />
	45. <em>See how compassionate she is, and humble,<br />
	How courteous and wise in her magnificence:<br />
	Resolve henceforth to call this one your lady.</em><br />
	See how compassionate and humble she is<br />
	how wise and courteous in her greatness:<br />
	and resolve to call her lady, by now!</p>

	<h2 class="content">Chapter I</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em>Now that by way of a preface my bread has been sufficiently prepared in the preceding book through my own assistance, time calls and requires my ship to leave port; thus, having set the sail of my reason to the breeze of my desire, I enter upon the open sea with the hope of a smooth voyage and a safe and praiseworthy port at the end of my feast. But so that this food of mine may be more profitable, I wish to show, before it appears, how the first course must be eaten.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	After that, by means of the discussion in the introduction, in which I performed the function of the one who serves at the table, my bread is sufficiently (adequately) prepared (as it cleansed of <a href="#convivioBookOne#bookI_ChapterII_1">accidental</a> and <a href="#convivioBookOne#bookI_ChapterV_1">substantial</a> stains) in the previous treatise, time calls and orders my ship to leave port (it is time for my task, my work, to begin), thus raised the sail (the mainsail) of my reason to the breeze of my desire, I enter upon the open sea (in the heart of the speech) with the hope of (making) a sweet way and reach, at the end of my dinner (exposition), a port where there is salvation (a safe port) and that makes me deserve praise. But so that this food of mine may be more profitable, before it's served the first course (the first song of the Convivio), I want to show you how to eat (out of metaphor, how a text should be interpreted).<br />
	The poet uses navigation as a metaphor for his own activity.</p>

<p>2. <em>As I stated in the first chapter, this exposition must be both literal and allegorical. To convey what this means, it is necessary to know that writings can be understood and ought to be expounded principally in four senses.</em><br />
	I say that, as has been said in the <a href="#convivioBookOne#bookI_ChapterI_18">first chapter</a> (of the first book), this exposition (comment) must be both literal and allegorical. And to understand it, it's necessary to know that writings can be understood and ought to be explained according to the maximum (up to) four senses.<br />
	3. <em>The first is called the literal, and this is the sense that does not go beyond the surface of the letter, as in the fables of the poets. The next is called the allegorical, and this is the one that is hidden beneath the cloak of these fables, and is a truth hidden beneath a beautiful fiction. Thus Ovid says that with his lyre Orpheus tamed wild beasts and made trees and rocks move toward him, which is to say that the wise man with the instrument of his voice makes cruel hearts grow tender and humble and moves to his will those who do not devote their lives to knowledge and art; and those who have no rational life whatsoever are almost like stones.</em><br />
	The first sense is called literal (level), and that's what does not go beyond the proper meaning (the letter) of the imaginary words (not real), as are the tales of the poets. The other (sense) is called allegorical and this is the sense that is hidden beneath the outward appearance of these fables, and it is a truth hidden beneath beautiful lie (fiction): as when Ovid said that Orpheus with his lyre tamed wild beasts, and (made) move towards him trees and rocks; which means that the wise man with the instrument of his voice can become mild and humble men cruel, and could move, according to his will, those who have no (intellectual) life of science and art; and those who have no life driven by reason are almost like stones.<br />
	The allegory in poetry is therefore the true meaning of the poetic tales, while the literal sense in itself is false.<br />
	4. <em>Why this kind of concealment was devised by the wise will be shown in the penultimate book. Indeed the theologians take this sense otherwise than do the poets; but since it is my intention here to follow the method of the poets, I shall take the allegorical sense according to the usage of the poets</em><br />
	And in the penultimate book it will explain why the wise men have been invented this hidden meaning. However theologians mean the allegory differently by poets, but since in this work is my intention to follow the manner (to understand the allegory) of the poets, I consider the allegorical sense as it is used by poets.<br />
	Dante specifies that while in the allegory of the poets the literal sense is fake (a beautiful lie), in the allegory of theologians is also true the literal sense (historically true as in the Bible), and that in the Convivio will follow the first.</p>

<p>5. <em>The third sense is called moral, and this is the sense that teachers should intently seek to discover throughout the scriptures, for their own profit and that of their pupils; as, for example, in the Gospel we may discover that when Christ ascended the mountain to be transfigured, of the twelve Apostles he took with him but three, the moral meaning of which is that in matters of great secrecy we should have few companions.</em><br />
	The third is called the moral sense, and this is what readers should intently go look in the scriptures, for their utility (for the benefit of themselves) and that of their pupils: as (for example) you can go look in the Gospel, when (it is said that) Christ ascended the mountain to be transfigured and (it says) of the twelve Apostles he took with him but three; in which the story can be understood in the moral sense that in the most secret things we have to be in the few company.<br />
	The moral sense then is the lesson to be drawn from the scriptures, for a rule of behavior. The example of Dante is also an allegory according to the theologians: the story of the Transfiguration of Christ (Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9:1-7, Luke 9:28-36), in which Christ brings to the mountain with him the three Apostles (Peter, John and James), is literally true and at the same time full of allegorical meanings.</p>

<p>6. <em>The fourth sense is called anagogical, that is to say, beyond the senses; and this occurs when a scripture is expounded in a spiritual sense which, although it is true also in the literal sense, signifies by means of the things signified a part of the supernal things of eternal glory, as may be seen in the song of the Prophet which says that when the people of Israel went out of Egypt, Judea was made whole and free.</em><br />
	The fourth sense is called anagogical, that is over the sense (beyond the senses, raising of the sense), and this occurs when a scripture is expounded according to the spiritual sense, which, although it is true also in the literal sense, for what it says (the things signified) is to represent (signifies) the divine (supernal) things of eternal glory, as my be seen in that song of the Prophet (in the song of Psalm 113), which says that, in the way out of the people of Israel from Egypt, Judea was made holy and free.<br />
	7. <em>For although it is manifestly true according to the letter, that which is spiritually intended is no less true, namely, that when the soul departs from sin it is made whole and free in its power.</em><br />
	For although it is manifest that this story is literally true, it is equally true the meaning that is to be understood in a spiritual sense, namely, that with the way out of the soul from sin, it is made holy and free obeying only to itself.<br />
	The story of the Exodus is the example of an allegory of theologians: in addition to the historical truth the story is in anagogical sense the ultimate destiny of the soul. The sense anagogical applies only to the allegory of theologians, and so may not be according to the allegory of poets, from the fables.<br />
	8. <em>In this kind of explication, the literal should always come first, as being the sense in whose meaning the others are enclosed, and without which it would be impossible and illogical to attend to the other senses, and especially the allegorical.</em><br />
	And in explaining this, the literal should be always in front (in the foreground), being the sense in whose meaning are enclosed the others, and without which it would be impossible and irrational to look to the others, and especially to the allegorical.<br />
	9. <em>It would be impossible because in everything that has an inside and an outside it is impossible to arrive at the inside without first arriving at the outside; consequently, since in what is written down the literal meaning is always the outside, it is impossible to arrive at the other senses, especially the allegorical, without first arriving at the literal.</em><br />
	It would be impossible because, in everything that has an inside and an outside, you can not get the inside without first looking at the outside, so, since in the scriptures the literal meaning is always the outside, it is impossible to arrive at the other meanings, especially the allegorical, without first understanding the literal.</p>

<p>15. <em>For these reasons, therefore, I shall on each occasion discuss first the literal meaning concerning each canzone, and afterwards I shall discuss its allegory (that is, the hidden truth), at times touching on the other senses, when opportune, as time and place deem proper.</em><br />
	For these reasons, therefore, I shall discuss always on each song first the literal meaning, and afterwards I shall discuss its allegory, that is the hidden truth; and at times I will incidentally (secondarily) touch on the other senses, as is required according to the opportunity.</p>

	<h2 class="content">Chapter II</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em>To begin, then, I say that after the passing of that blessed Beatrice who lives in heaven with the angels and on earth with my soul, the star of Venus had twice revolved in that circle of hers, which at different times of the year makes her appear in the evening or in the morning, when that gentle lady, of whom I made mention at the end of the New Life, first appeared before my eyes, accompanied by Love, and took a place within my mind.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	To begin, then, I say that the star of Venus had covered twice her circle (the orbit around the Earth) which makes her appear in the evening and in the morning, at different times (according to the rotation of its epicycle), after the passing of that blessed Beatrice who lives in heaven with the angels and on earth with my soul, when that gentle woman, of whom I made mentioned at the end of the New Life (Vita Nuova), appeared in my sight, primarily, accompanied by Love, and she stared in my mind.<br />
	Venus according to the Ptolemaic astronomy had two movements: revolve around the Earth along a circumference (deferent) in 584 days and revolved around a second circle (epicycle) with center the first one. By having Venus made the orbit around the Earth twice, it have elapsed about three years after the death of Beatrice took place in 1290.<br />
	2. <em>As I have recounted in the above-mentioned little book, it came to pass that I consented to be hers more because of her gentleness than through choice of my own; for she showed herself to be impassioned by so great a pity for my widowed life that the spirits of my eyes became most friendly toward her. And having accomplished this, they then so fashioned her within me that my pleasure was content to wed itself to that image.</em><br />
	And as it talked about me in the introduction above, it came to pass that I consented to be hers more for her gentleness than through my free choice; for she (the gentle woman) show transported by so great mercy for my life now widow (of Beatrice), that my looks became completely her friends. And in this way, they then so fashioned such a picture of her within me, that my will was pleased to wed itself to that image.<br />
	3. <em>But because love is not born and does not grow and reach perfection in a moment but requires time and nourishment of thought, especially where there are opposing thoughts that impede it, it was necessary before this new love could become perfect that there be much strife between the thought that nourished it and the one that opposed it, which still held the citadel of my mind on behalf of that glorious Beatrice.</em><br />
	But because love is not born suddenly and does not become great and perfect (total) in a moment, but requires (the proper) time and nourishment of thougth, especially where there are opposing thoughts that impede it, it was necessary before this new love could become perfect, a great battle between the thought that fed it (one for the gentle woman) and the one that opposed it, that for that glorious Beatrice which still tightly occupied my mind.<br />
	4. <em>For the one was continually reinforced by the part of the memory in front, and the other by the part of the memory in back; and the support in front, being that which hindered me from turning my gaze in any way backward, increased with each day, which the other could not do; hence it seemed to me so wonderful and also so hard to endure that I could not bear it.</em><br />
	But the one (the thought for gentle woman) was continually helped by the part to see in front, and the other (the thought of Beatrice) instead it was by the part of the memory (the past), in back. And the support in front grew each day, which the other could not do, being that hindering me in any way from turning my face backward; for which reason it seemed so wonderful, and also hard to endure, I could not bear it.<br />
	5. <em>And almost crying out aloud, to excuse myself for the change in which I seemed to show a lack of strength, I directed my voice to that quarter from which the victory of the new thought emerged, which was most powerful, like celestial virtue; and I began by saying You whose intellect the third sphere moves.</em><br />
	And almost exclaiming, to excuse myself for the change (of my thought), in which it seemed that I had not (enough) power (will), I directed my voice to that part from which the new victorious thought came from (the sky of Venus, that of Love), which was so full of virtue as the celestial virtue; and I began by saying: 'You whose intellect the third sphere moves'.</p>

<p>6. <em>To apprehend the meaning of this canzone properly it is first necessary to know its parts, so that afterwards it will be easy to perceive its meaning. And so that there should be no need of placing these words in front of the expositions of the other canzoni, I say that the order which will be adopted in this book I intend to maintain also for the others.</em><br />
	To apprehend properly the meaning of this song (canzone), it is first necessary to know its parts, so that afterwards it will be easy to perceive its (true) meaning. And so that no longer required to state these words in front of the exposition of the other (songs), I say that the order which will be adopted in this book, I intend to mantain for the others.</p>

<p>7. <em>I say then that the canzone before us is composed of three principal parts. The first is the first stanza of the canzone: here certain Intelligences, or Angels, as we are more accustomed to call them, which preside over the revolution of the heaven of Venus as its movers, are invited to listen to what I intend to say.</em><br />
	I say then that the proposal canzone consists of three main parts. The first (part) is the first verse (to be understood the first stanza) of that canzone: in which are invited certain Intelligences to listen what I intend to say, that is those that most commonly call Angels, which preside over for the revolution of the heaven of Venus as its movers.<br />
	8. <em>The second comprises the three stanzas which follow the first: here is shown what was heard within, spiritually, between the different thoughts.</em><br />
	The second (main part of the song) are the three stanzas that come after the first: in which (part) is shown what it felt (fought) within my soul (divided) between thoughts so different.<br />
	9. <em>The third is the fifth and last stanza: here one generally addresses the work itself, as if to encourage it. All three of these parts, as has been indicated above, will be explicated in order.</em><br />
	The third (main part of the song) is the fifth and last stanza: in which the author addresses the work itself, as if to encourage it. And all three of these parts, in the order which they are, as has been said above, I intend to demonstrate.</p>

	<h2 class="content">Chapter III</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em id="bookII_ChapterIII_1">In order to discern more clearly the literal sense of the first part according to the division made above (which is our present concern), we must know who and how many they are who are summoned to hear me, and what this third heaven is which I say they move; first I will speak of the heaven, and then I will speak of those whom I address.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	In order to discern more clearly the literal sense of the first part (main part of the song) divided according to the above, which it now my commit, it is to know who and how many are they who are called to hear me, and what is this third heaven who I say they move; and before I will speak of the heaven, then I will speak of those whom I address.</p>

<p>7. <em>The order of their position is as follows. The first in number is the one in which the Moon resides; the second is the one in which Mercury resides; the third is the one in which Venus resides; the fourth is the one in which the Sun resides; the fifth is that of Mars; the sixth is that of Jupiter; the seventh is that of Saturn; the eighth is that of the Stars; the ninth is the one which is not perceptible to the senses except for the movement mentioned above, and which many call the Crystalline (that is to say, the diaphanous or completely transparent) Heaven.</em><br />
	And this is the order of the position (of heavens), which the first one (which astrologers and philosophers, Chapter III, 2-6) list is where the Moon resides; the second is the one in which Mercury resides; the third is the one in which Venus resides; the fourth is the one in which the Sun resides; the fifth is that of Mars; the sixth is that of Jupiter; the seventh is that of Saturn; the eighth is that of the Stars; the ninth is that which can not be determined with experience sensitive except for the movement that has been said above (Chapter III, 5), which many call Crystalline, that is the diaphanous or completely transparent one (Heaven).<br />
	8. <em>Moreover, outside all of these the Catholics place the Empyrean Heaven, which is to say, the “heaven of flame,” or “luminous heaven”; and they hold it to be motionless because it has in itself, with respect to each of its parts, that which its matter desires. </em><br />
	In truth, outside of all these (heavens), Catholics place the Empyrean heaven, which is to say heaven of flame or very luminous heaven; and they consider it to be motionless because it has in itself, according to each of its parts, what its matter wants (the object of his desire, God).<br />
	9. <em>This is the reason why the Primum Mobile has the swiftest movement; for because of the most fervent desire that each part of the ninth heaven has to be conjoined with every part of that divinest, tranquil heaven, to which it is contiguous, it revolves beneath it with such desire that its velocity is almost incomprehensible.</em><br />
	And this is the reason why the First Mobile has the very fast movement; because for the most fervent (passionate) desire that is in each part of the ninth heaven has to be conjoined with every part of that divinest, tranquil heaven, to which it is contiguous, it revolves beneath it with such desire that its velocity is almost incomprehensible.<br />
	10. <em>Stillness and peace are the qualities of the place of that Supreme Deity which alone completely beholds itself. This is the place of the blessed spirits, according to the will of the Holy Church, which cannot lie. Aristotle, to anyone who rightly understands him, seems to hold the same opinion in the first book of Heaven and the World.</em><br />
	And motionless and peaceful is the place of thar Supreme Deity which alone completely beholds itself. This (The Empyrean heaven) is the place of the blessed spirits, as dictated by the Holy Church, who can not tell lie; and Aristotle, for those who rightly understands him, seems to hold it in his first (book) of De Celo et Mundo (On the Heavens).<br />
	11. <em>This is the supreme edifice of the universe in which all the world is enclosed and beyond which there is nothing; it is not itself in space but was formed solely in the Primal Mind, which the Greeks call Protonoe. This is that magnificence of which the Psalmist spoke when he says to God: “Your magnificence is exalted above the heavens.”</em><br />
	This (The Empyrean) is the supreme building of the world (universe), in which the whole world (universe) is enclosed, and beyond which is nothing, and it does not exist in (any) place but it was only formed in the First Mind (resides in God), which the Greeks call Protonoè. This is that magnificence (do great things and admirable) of which the Psalmist spoke (in Psalm 8:1) when he says to God: "Your magnificence is elevated above the heavens."<br />
	12. <em>So to sum up what has been said, it is apparent that there are ten heavens, of which the heaven of Venus is the third, mention of which is made in that part of the canzone which I now intend to explicate.</em><br />
	So summing up what has been spoken, it appears that ten are the heavens, of which that of Venus is the third, mentioned in that part (of the song) which I now intend to show.</p>

<p>1. <em>Now that in the preceding chapter it has been shown what this third heaven is and how it is ordered in itself, it remains to show who they are who move it.</em><br />
	After that in the preceding chapter it has been shown what is this third heaven (that of Venus, Chapter III, 7-12), and how it is ordered in itself (Chapter III, 13-18), it remains to show who they are who move it.<my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	2. <em>And so we must first know that its movers are substances separate from matter, namely Intelligences, which the common people call Angels. Although the truth is now known, different people have held different opinions about these creatures as they have about the heavens.</em><br />
	And so it must be first know that the movers of those (the heavens) are substances separate from matter (immaterial), namely intelligence, which the common people call Angels. And about these creatures, of whom (in the past) many have had different opinions as (they have had) about the heavens, the truth is now known.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Chapter V</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em>It has been said that because of a lack of instruction the ancients did not perceive the truth concerning spiritual creatures, even though the people of Israel were in part taught by their prophets, “through whom, by many manners of speech and in many ways, God had spoken to them,” as the Apostle says.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	It has been said (in the previous chapter, Chapter IV 3-8) that the ancient people did not see the true nature of spiritual creatures for lack of instruction, even though the people of Israel were partly taught by their prophets, "through whom, by many manners of speech and in many ways, God had spoken to them," as the Apostle says (Paul's First Epistle to the Hebrews).<br />
	2. <em>But we have been taught about this by him who came from him, by him who made them, by him who preserves them, that is by the Emperor of the Universe, who is Christ, son of the sovereign God and son of the Virgin Mary, the true woman and daughter of Joachim and of Adam, the true man who was slain by us, by which he brought us to life.</em><br />
	But we (Christians) are educated about this (the true nature of spiritual creatures) by him who came from that (God), by him who made them, to him who preserve them, that is by the Emperor of the Universe, who is Christ the, son of sovereign God and son of the Virgin Mary, the true woman (in flesh and blood) and daughter of Joachim and of Adam, the true man (in flesh and blood), who was slain by us (men), for (by his death) he brought us to life.<br />
	3. <em>“He was the light that shines for us in the darkness,” as John the Evangelist says; and he told us the truth concerning those things which without him we could not know nor truly perceive.</em><br />
	'Who (Christ) was the light that shines for us in the darkness', as John the Evangelist says (in his Gospel 1:5), and he told us the truth concerning those things which without him we could not know nor see in truth.</p>

<p>4. <em>The first thing and the first secret that he showed us was one of the above-mentioned creatures, and this was his great ambassador who came to Mary, a young maiden thirteen years of age, on behalf of the heavenly Healer. Our Saviour said with his own lips that the Father was able to give him many legions of angels; when he was told that the Father had ordered the Angels to minister unto and serve him, he did not deny it was true.</em><br />
	The first thing and the first secret that he showed us was one of the above-mentioned creatures, (and) this was his great ambassador (the Archangel Gabriel) who came to Mary, a young maiden of thirteen years of age, on behalf of the heavenly Healer. This our Savior said with his own lips that the Father could give (him) many legions (a multitude) of angels; when he was told that the Father had ordered the Angels to minister to and serve him, these (he, the Savior) did not deny it was true.<br />
	5. <em>Consequently it is evident to us that those creatures exist in extraordinary numbers, for his spouse and secretary the Holy Church–of whom Solomon says “Who is this that comes from the desert, laden with those things that give delight, leaning upon her friend?”–affirms, believes, and preaches that these most noble creatures are all but innumerable. And she divides them into three hierarchies, which is to say three holy or divine principalities, each hierarchy having three orders, so that the Church holds and affirms that there are nine orders of spiritual creatures.</em><br />
	Consequently it is evident to us that those (spiritual) creatures are in extraordinary numbers; for the his (Christ) spouse and repository of secrets, the Holy Church - of whom Solomon says (in his Song of Songs 8:5): “Who is this coming up from the desert, full of those things that give delight, leaning upon her friend?” - says, believes and preaches that these noble creatures are almost innumerable. And she divides them into three hierarchies, which is to say three holy or truly divine principalities, and each hierarchy having three orders; so that the Church holds and affirms that there are nine orders of spiritual creatures (intelligences).<br />
	6. <em>The first is that of the Angels, the second of the Archangels, the third of the Thrones; and these three orders make up the first hierarchy: not first in order of nobility, nor of creation (for the others are nobler and all were created at one time), but first in the order of our ascent to their degree of elevation. Then come the Dominations, next the Virtues, then the Principalities, and these make up the second hierarchy. Above these are the Powers and the Cherubim, and above all are the Seraphim, and these make up the third hierarchy.</em><br />
	The first (order) is that of the Angels, the second of the Archangels, the third of the Thrones; and these three orders make up the first hierarchy: not first (hierarchy) in terms of nobility, nor (first) of creation (for the others are nobler and all were created at one time), but first (closest) (in the order) of our ascent climbing to their (degree of) elevation.Then come the Dominations, close (to) the Virtues, then the Principalities; and these (three orders) make up the second hierarchy. Above these are the Powers and Cherubim, and above all there are the Seraphim: and these (three orders) make up the third hierarchy.<br />
	7. <em>The principal motive of their contemplation lies in the numerical position in which the hierarchies and in which the orders reside. For, since the Divine Majesty exists in three persons who have one substance, it is possible to contemplate them in a threefold manner.</em><br />
	And the principale cause of their meditation lies in the numerical position in which the hierarchies reside and in which the orders reside. For, since the Divine Majesty exists in three persons, who have one substance, it is possible to contemplate them in a threefold manner.<br />
	8. <em>For it is possible to contemplate the supreme power of the Father, upon which the first hierarchy gazes, that is, the one which is first in nobility and which we count as last. It is also possible to contemplate the supreme wisdom of the Son; this the second hierarchy gazes upon. And it is possible to contemplate the supreme and most fervent love of the Holy Spirit; this the last hierarchy gazes upon, which being nearest to us bestows upon us the gifts which it receives.</em><br />
	For it is possible to contemplate the supreme power of the Father, upon which the first hierarchy admires, that is, the one which is first in nobility and which we count as last (in ascending order, the most distant from us). And it is possible to contemplate the supreme wisdom of the Son; and this second hierarchy admires. And it is possible to contemplate the supreme and most fervent (passion) love of the Holy Spirit; and this last hierarchy admires, which being nearest to us, presents upon us the gifts which it receives.<br />
	9. <em>Since each person of the divine Trinity can be considered in a threefold manner, there are in each hierarchy three orders that contemplate in different ways. It is possible to consider the Father with regard to but him alone, and this contemplation the Seraphim perform, who perceive more of the First Cause than any other angelic nature.</em><br />
	Since each person in the divine Trinity can be considered in a threefold manner, in each hierarchy there are three orders that contemplate differently. It can be considered the Father, with regard to but him alone, and this contemplation the Seraphim perform, who perceive more of the First Cause (the origin of all things) than any other angelic nature.<br />
	10. <em>It is possible to consider the Father with respect to the relation he has to the Son, that is, how he is separated from him and how united with him; and this the Cherubim contemplate. It is further possible to consider the Father with respect to how the Holy Spirit proceeds from him, and how it is separated from him and how united with him; and this contemplation the Powers perform.</em><br />
	It can be considered the Father according to the relation he has to the Son, that is, how he is separated from him and how he is united with; and this the Cherubim contemplate. It can be further consider the Father according as the Holy Spirit proceeds (comes) from him, and how he is separated from him and how he is united with; and this contemplation the Powers perform.<br />
	11. <em>In this same way it is possible to contemplate the Son and the Holy Spirit: consequently it is appropriate that there should be nine classes of contemplative spirits, to gaze upon the light which can only be completely beheld by itself.</em><br />
	And in the same way (as for the Father) it can be meditate the Son and the Holy Spirit: so it is appropriate that there should be nine classes of contemplative spirits, admiring in the light which can only completely (fully) behold itself.</p>

<p>12. <em>Here one word must not be left unsaid. I say that of all these orders a certain number were lost as soon as they were created, perhaps one-tenth in number, for the restoration of which part human nature was afterwards created. The moving heavens, which are nine, declare the numbers, the orders, and the hierarchies, and the tenth proclaims the very unity and stability of God. Therefore the Psalmist says: “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.”</em><br />
	And here one (more) word must be not left unsaid. I say that all these orders a certian number were lost as soon as they were created, perhaps one-tenth in number; for restoration of which part human nature (the man) was afterwards created. The moving heavens, which are nine, declare the number, the orders, and the hierarchies, and the tenth proclaims the very unity and stability of God. And therefore the Psalmist (in the Psalm 18) says: "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament (the vault of heavens) announces the works of his hands".<br />
	The intelligences that were lost are the rebellious angels of God led by Lucifer and precipitates in Hell according to the Old Testament.<br />
	13. <em>Consequently it is reasonable to believe that the movers of the heaven of the Moon belong to the order of the Angels, and those of Mercury to that of the Archangels, and those of Venus to that of the Thrones; all of whom, receiving their nature from the love of the Holy Spirit, perform their operation, which is innate in them, namely, the movement of that heaven, filled with love, from which the form of the said heaven derives a potent ardor by which the souls here below are kindled to love, according to their disposition.</em><br />
	Consequently it is to reasonable to believe that the movers of the heaven of the Moon are of (belong to) the order of the Angels, and those of Mercury are the Archangels, and those of Venus are the Thrones; (all of) whom, receiving their nature by the love of the Holy Spirit, perform their operation, which is innate in them, namely, the movement of that heaven (Venus), filled with love, from which (movement) a passion full of virtue (potent ardor) takes the form of the said heaven, by which (passion) the souls here below are kindled to love, according to their disposition (to receive it).<br />
	14. <em>Because the ancients recognized that this heaven was the cause of love here below, they said that Love was the son of Venus, as Vergil attests to in the first book of the Aeneid, where Venus says to Love: «My son, my power, son of the supreme father, who heeds not the darts of Typhoeus»; and Ovid, in the fifth book of the Metamorphoses, when he says that Venus said to Love: «My son, my arms, my power».</em><br />
	And when the ancients recognized that this heaven was here below cause of love, they said that was the son of Venus, as Virgil attests to in the first book (664) of the Aeneid, where Venus says to Love: «My son, my virtues, son of the supreme father, who do heed not the darts of Typhoeus»; and Ovid, in the fifth book (365) of the Metamorphoses, when he says that Venus said to Love: «My son, my arms, my power».<br />
	Here it is necessary to specify that Dante, with all my reverence, misinterpreted the verse of the Aeneid, because is Jupiter throwing lightning to Typhoesus and not vice versa.</p>

<p>1. <em>According to what was said above in the third chapter of this book, it was necessary, in order to understand properly the first part of the canzone before us, to speak of those heavens and of those who move them, and in the preceding three chapters this has been discussed. I say then to those whom I have shown to be the movers of the heaven of Venus: You whose intellect–that is, whose intellect alone, as has been said above–the third sphere moves, Now listen to the speech; and I do not say “listen” as though they should hear sound, for they have no sense perception, but I say “listen,” that is, with that hearing which they do have, which is understanding by the intellect.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	According to what was said above, in the <a href="#convivioBookTwo#bookII_ChapterIII_1">third chapter</a> of this book, that it was necessary, in order to understand properly the first part of the proposed canzone, to speak of those heavens and of those who move them, in the preceding three chapters has been discussed (it). I say then (at the beginning of the proposed canzone) to those whom I have shown to be the movers of the heaven of Venus: <em>You whose intellect</em> – that is, whose intellect alone, as has been said above – <em>the third sphere moves, Now listen to the speech</em>;
	and I do not say listen as though they should hear sound, for they have no sense perception, but I say, listen, that is, with that hearing which they do have, which is understanding by the intellect.<br />
	2. <em>I say: Listen to the speech that is in my heart, that is, within me, for it has not yet appeared without. And we must know that throughout this entire canzone, according to the one sense and the other, the “heart” is to be taken as the secret place within and not as some special part of the soul or body.</em><br />
	I say: <em>Listen to the speech that is in my heart</em>, that is, within me, for it has not yet appeared without. And it is to know that throughout this entire canzone, according to the one sense (the literal sense) and the other (the allegory), the 'heart' is to be taken as the secret place within, and not as some specific part of the soul and body.</p>

<p>3. <em>After I have summoned them to listen to what I wish to say, I assign two reasons why it is fitting for me to speak to them. One is the strangeness of my condition, which not having been experienced by other men could not be so well understood by them as by those beings who understand their own effects in their operation; and this reason I touch on when I say For I cannot speak to others, so strange it seems.</em><br />
	After that I have summoned them to listen to what I wish to say, I assign two reasons why I have to speak properly to them. One is the strangeness of my condition, which not having been experienced by other men could not be so well understood by them as by those (spiritual creatures) who understand their own effects (consequences) in their operation; and this reason I touch when I say: <em>For I cannot say to others, so strange it seems.</em><br />
	4. <em>The other reason is that when a person receives a benefit or an injury, he must first relate it to the one who has brought it about, if he can, rather than to others; so that if it is a benefit, he who receives it shows himself grateful toward his benefactor; and if it is an injury, he should move the malefactor with gentle words to kind compassion.</em><br />
	The other reason (I do talk to them, spiritual creatures) is: when a man receives benefit or a true injury, if he can, he must first relate it to the one who has brought it about, rather than to others; for if it is benefit, the one who receives it should shows his gratitude toward his benefactor; and if it injury, he should induces the malfactor with gentle words to kind mercy (compassion).<br />
	5. <em>I touch on this reason when I say The heaven that moves according to your power Draws me, O noble creatures that you are, into the state in which I find myself–that is to say, your operation (that is, your revolution) is what has drawn me into my present condition. Consequently I conclude by stating that my speech must be to them, as has been said; and this I say with the words And hence these words About the life I live Should properly be addressed to you. After assigning these reasons, I beg them to listen to me when I say And so I pray that you will listen to me. </em><br />
	I touch on this reason when I say <em>The heaven that moves according to your power Draws me, O noble creatures that you are, into the state in which I find myself.</em> That is to say, your operation, that is your circular motion, is what has drawn me into my present condition. Therefore I conclude and say that my speech must be to them, as has been said (above, relating first the benefit to the benefactor); and this I say here: <em>About the life I live Should properly be addressed to you.</em> And after assigning these reasons, I beg them to listen when I say: <em>And so I pray that you will listen to me</em> (and understand me as pure intellect).<br />
	6. <em>But because in every kind of discourse the speaker should above all be intent on persuading (that is, on charming) his audience to listen–for this is the beginning of all other persuasions, according to the practice of the rhetoricians–and since the most potent persuasion for rendering the listener attentive is to promise to tell new and momentous things, 
	I arrange to have this persuasion (that is, this charm) follow after the petition to be heard, announcing my intention to them, which is to speak of new things (that is, of the division that is in my soul) and of momentous things (that is, of the influence of their star). And this I say in the last words of this first part: I shall recount the strangeness in my heart, How here within my sad soul weeps And how against her speaks a spirit that comes Upon the rays descending from your star.</em><br />
	But as in every kind of discourse (sermon) the speaker should above all be intent on persuading his audience to listen, that is on charming, for this is the beginning of all other persuasions as rhetoricians know (according to the practice of rhetoric); and since the most potent persuasion for rendering the listener attentive is to promises to tell new and momentous things; 
	this persuasion, that is this charm (of my canzone), I do follow after the petition to my audience, announcing my intention to them, which is to speak about new things, that is the division that is in my soul (for two opposing thoughts), and momentous things, that is the value (virtue) of their star (Venus). And I say this in the last words of this first part: <em>I shall recount the strangeness in my heart, How here within my sad soul weeps And how against her speaks a spirit that comes Upon the rays descending from your star.</em></p>

<p>7. <em>To convey the full meaning of these words, I say that this spirit is nothing other than a frequent thought to praise and adorn this new lady; and this soul is nothing other than another thought accompanied by an act of assent, which, opposing the former, praises and adorns the memory of that glorious Beatrice.</em><br />
	And for the full meaning of these words, I say that this spirit is nothing other than a frequent thought to praise and adorn this new lady; and this soul is nothing other than another thought (to Beatrice) accompained by an act assent, which opposing this (spirit), praise and andorn the memory of the that glorious Beatrice.<br />
	8. <em>But since the final verdict of my mind (that is, its act of assent) was still held fast by this thought which my memory reinforces, I call it souland the other spirit; just as we are used to calling a “city” those who hold it and not those who are attacking it, even though both are citizens.</em><br />
	But since the final verdict of my mind, that is the consensus, was still held by this thought helped by my memory, I call this soul and the other spirit; as we are used to calling the city those who govern it, and not those who are attiacking it (as opposition to the government), even though the one and the other is citizen.<br />
	9. <em>I say, moreover, that this spirit comes upon the rays of the star, because it is necessary to know that the rays of each heaven are the paths along which their virtue descends upon these things here below. Since rays are nothing other than the shining which comes from the source of the light through the air to the thing illuminated, and there is no light except from the body of the star, because the rest of the heaven is diaphanous (that is, transparent), I do not say that this spirit (that is, this thought) comes from their heaven as a whole but from their star.</em><br />

<p>1. <em>We have thus explained the meaning of the part in which the soul speaks (that is, of the old thought which was destroyed).

	Proved is the meaning of that part in which the soul speaks (Chapters VII-IX), that is the old thought (the one for Beatrice) which is being corrupted.

	2. <em>To be correctly understood, this part must be divided in two: in the first part the opposing thought reprimands the soul for cowardice; and later in the second, beginning with the words See how compassionate she is</em>, he declares what this reprimanded soul must do.<br />
	To be correctly understood this part must be divided in two: in the first, the opposing thought reprimands against the soul for cowardice; and later he declares what this reprimanded soul must do, that is in the second part, beginning with <em>See how compassionate she is</em>.</p>

<p>3. <em>He says then, continuing from her last words: it is not true that you are slain; but the reason that you seem to be slain is the bewilderment into which you have fallen so abjectly for this lady who has appeared. Here it must be noted that, as Boethius says in his Consolation, “no sudden change in things can take place without some perturbation of the mind.”</em><br />
	He (the little spirit of love) says then, continuing to her (the soul) last words: It is not true that you are dead; but the reason why you seem to be dead, is a bewilderment into you have fallen so abjectlt for this lady who has appeared - and here it is to be noted that, as Boethius says in his Consolation (in his book De consolatione philosophiae II, 1, 3) "no sudden change in thing can take place without some perturbation of the mind" -; and this means the reproach of this thought.<br />
	4. <em>This is the meaning of the reprimand made by this thought, which is called a “little spirit of love,” to indicate that my consent inclined towards him; and so we can understand this all the better and recognize his victory, since he already says “our soul,” thereby making himself intimate with her.</em><br />
	Which is called 'little spirit of love' to indicate that my consent inclined toward him; and so it can understand this all the better, and recognize his victory, already when he says 'our soul', thereby making himself intimate with her.<br />
	5. <em>Then as has been said, he declares what this reprimanded soul must do in order to come to him, and he says to her See how compassionate she is, and humble, for the appropriate remedy to fear, by which the soul seems possessed, consists of two things; and these, especially when joined, are what cause a person to have good hope, and above all compassion, which makes every other goodness shine with its light. This is why Vergil, in speaking of Aeneas, sings his greatest praise by calling him compassionate.</em><br />
	Then as been said, he (the little spirit of love) declares what this reprimanded soul must do in order to come to him, and he says to her: <em>See how compassionate she is, and humble</em>, because the appropriate remedy to fear, by which the soul seemed possessed, consists two things, and these, especially when joined, are what cause a person to have good hope, and above all compassion, which makes every other goodnes shines with its light. This is why Vergil, in speaking of Aeneas, to his greatest praise calling him compassionate.<br />
	6. <em>And compassion is not what the common people think it is, namely, grieving over another’s misfortune, which is one of its special effects that is called pity, and is an emotion. Compassion, however, is not an emotion, but rather a noble disposition of the mind, ready to receive love, pity, and other emotions arising out of charity.</em><br />

<p>7. <em>Then he says: See also how she is courteous and wise in her magnificence. Here he speaks of three things which, among those that can be acquired by us, especially make a person pleasing. He says “wise”: now what is more beautiful in a woman than to be wise? He says “courteous”: nothing is more becoming in a woman than courtesy. And the wretches of the common herd should not be deceived as well by this word, thinking courtesy nothing other than liberality; for liberality is a special, not a general, kind of courtesy!</em><br />

	8. <em>Courtesy and dignity are one and the same; and because in the courts in times past virtue and fine manners were practiced, just as the contrary is now the case, this word was derived from courts and “courtesy” was as much as to say “the custom of the court.” If this word were derived from the courts of the present day, especially those of Italy, it would mean nothing but rudeness.</em><br />

	Similarly, the sciences are the cause in us of bringing about the second perfection, for the habit (by the possesion) of which we are able inspect the truth, which is the our greatest perfection, as the Philosopher says in the sixth (book) of the Ethics, when he says that true is the good of the intellect. Because of these, as well as many other kinds of similarity, science may be called 'heaven'. Now it remains to seen why 'third' heaven is said.<br />
	7. <em>Now it remains to be seen why “third” heaven is said. For this it is necessary to give consideration to a comparison that obtains between the order of the heavens and that of the sciences. As was stated above, then, the seven heavens nearest to us are those of the planets; next come two heavens above them, which are in motion, and one above them all, which is still.</em><br />

<p>13. <em>The heaven of Venus may be compared to Rhetoric because of two properties: one is the brightness of its aspect, which is sweeter to look upon than that of any other star; the other is its appearance now in the morning, now in the evening.</em><br />
	And the heaven of Venus may be compared to Rhetoric for two properties: the first is the brightness of its aspect, which is sweeter to look upon than that any other star, the other is its appearance, now in the morning, now in the evening.<br />
	14. <em>And these two properties are found in Rhetoric: for Rhetoric is sweeter than all of the other sciences, since this is what it principally aims at; and it appears in the morning when the rhetorician speaks before the face of his hearer, and it appears in the evening (that is, behind) when the rhetorician speaks through writing, from a distance.</em><br />
	And these two properties are found in Rhetoric: for Rhetoric is sweeter than all the other sciences, since to this (the sweetness) it principally intends (this is what it principally aims at); and it appears in the morning when the rhetorician (who makes use of Rhetoric) speaks (directly) in front of the face of his hearer, it appears in the evening, that is behind, when the rhetorician speaks through the letter (writes), from a distance.</p>

<p>1. <em>By the resemblances discussed it may be seen who are these movers to whom I speak, who are the movers of this heaven, like Boethius and Tully, who with the sweetness of their discourse guided me, as has been said above, along the path of love–that is, into the pursuit of this most gentle lady Philosophy, by the rays of their star, which is their writing about her; for in every science the written word is a star filled with light which reveals that science.<my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref></em><br />
	By the resemblances discussed (Chapter XIII, Chapter XIV) it may be seen who are these movers to whom I speak, who are the movers of this heaven, like Boethius and Tully, who with the sweetness of their discourse guided me, as has been said above  (<a href="#convivioBookTwo#bookII_ChapterXII_1">Chapter XII</a>), in the love, that is in the study, of this most gentle lady Philosophy, by the rays of their star, which is their writing about her (Philosophy); for in every science the written word is as star filled with light, which reveals that science.<br />
	2. <em>Once this is understood, we may perceive the true meaning of the first stanza of the canzone before us by means of the fictive and literal exposition.

	And, clarified that, it may perceive the true meaning of the first stanza of the canzone before us by the fictive and literal exposition. By means of this same exposition the second stanza may be sufficiently understood, as far as the part where it says <em>This one makes me behold a lady</em>.<br />
	3. <em>Here we must observe that this lady is Philosophy, who truly is a lady full of sweetness, adorned with honor, wondrous in wisdom, glorious in freedom, as will be made manifest in the third book, which will treat her nobleness.</em><br />
	Here we must know that this lady is Philosophy, who truly is a lady full of sweetness, adorned with dignity, wondrous in wisdom, glorious in freedom, as will be manifest in the third book, which will treat her nobleness.</p>

<p>10. <em>Then in the fourth stanza where it says a gentle spirit of love, it means a thought that is born of my study. Here it should be known that by love in this allegory is always meant that study which is the application of the mind to that thing of which it is enamored. </em><br />
	Then in the fourth stanza where it (canzone) says: <em>a gentle spirit of love</em>, it means a thought that is born of my study. Here it should be know that by love, in this allegory, it always refers to the study, which is the application of the mind to that thing of which it is enamored.<br />
	...<br />
	12. <em>All the rest that follows in this canzone has been made sufficiently clear by the previous exposition. So at the end of this second book I assert and affirm that the lady of whom I was enamored after my first love was the most beautiful and honorable daughter of the Emperor of the universe, to whom Pythagoras gave the name of Philosophy. Here ends the second book, whose purpose has been to explicate the canzone which is served as the first course</em><br />
	All the rest that follows in this canzone has been sufficiently clear by the other exposition (allegorical). And so, at the end of this second book, I assert and affirm that the lady of whom I was enamored after my first love (Beatrice) was the most beautiful and most honorable daughter of the Emperor of the universe, to whom Pythagoras gave the name Philosophy. And here ends the second book, which is planned to present the canzone that as my first meat is put in front.</p>
