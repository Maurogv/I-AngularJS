 <pre><em>The day was going, and the embrowned air
released the animals that are on earth
from their fatigues; and I the only one,
prepared myself to sustain the war
of the way and of the pity,
which shall retrace the <a id="mind" href="#preamble#memory">mind</a> that not error.</em></pre>

<p>The day was ending, and dusk<my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
    subtracts (forces and allow to rest) all living things (animals and humans)<br />
    from their daily works (their work); and I only among the living,<br />
    I was going to support the strain<br />
    of the journey and of the mercy (compassion that I would have suffered)<br />
    that (my) memory, true and infallible record of every event, will report.</p>

<p>Dante fallen into sin and ended up in the darkness of hell, after finding comfort in Virgil who offers to guide him to Hell and to Purgatory (Inferno I), is aware of the hard trail (the war) who will have to face, physical (the way) and morality, compassion (the pity) to the punishment of the damned, entrusting to his memory infallible the remembrance of what he will live to tell the tale.<br />
    In the same way my memory that is not wrong shows the path of examinations, words, pauses, gestures, organization that lead to a diagnosis and its treatment in hospitals, doctors&#39; surgeries, dentists and
    that heard in the life of every day, then tell the tale.</p>
