<pre><em>The day was going, and the embrowned air
released the animals that are on earth
from their fatigues; and I the only one,
prepared myself to sustain the war
of the way and of the pity,
which shall retrace the <a id="mind" href="#preamble#memory">mind</a> that not error.</em></pre>

<p>The day was ending, and dusk<my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	subtracts (forces and allow to rest) all living things that moves (animals and humans)<br />
	from their daily works (their work); and I only among the living,<br />
	I was going to support the strain<br />
	of the journey and of the mercy (compassion that I would have suffered)<br />
	that (my) memory, true and infallible record of every event, will report.</p>

<p>Dante fallen into sin and ended up in the darkness of hell, after finding comfort in Virgil who offers to guide him to Hell and to Purgatory (Inferno I), is aware of the hard trail (the war) who will have to face, physical (the way) and morality, compassion (the pity) to the punishment of the damned, entrusting to his memory infallible the remembrance of what he will live to tell the tale.<br />
	Likewise, my not mistaken memory portrays the accident of a fall that I was the victim of. There are the following moments, medical visits, state of health, social and family life. I am sorry for talking about myself from the danger and injustice. I go into detail, illustrating the patient-doctor relationship, and this with the health facility, and care. Memory is aided by available data, reports and examinations. A disheartening picture will emerge: ignorance and lack of discernment, that is when reason does not perceive (and does not learn) the differences of things as they tend to a specific end. Of this I too was a sheep who followed a flock led by blind guides, asking God for help late. The result can only be the underestimation of the danger by everyone and inevitable, disagreements and misunderstandings family. Other things I note, poor topics of conversation, malice in seeking excuses . And again, unnecessary care, when not done badly, derision and betrayal of the patient, the importance of the family. Healthcare is disorganized and corrupted by money, like the world, addressed to the useless and continuous search for pleasure and money. Thus, for years, and probably until his death, not before he is impoverished, the sufferer is forced to choose between not caring, and hiding is often the least worst choice, or to do so in hypocrital and mediocre facilities. In them, sometimes after a long wait in the public ones, he will see the above repeated without healing.</p>
