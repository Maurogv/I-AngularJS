	<h2 class="content">Chapter I</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em>As the Philosopher says at the beginning of the First Philosophy, all men by nature desire to know. The reason for this can be and is that each thing, impelled by a force provided by its own nature, inclines towards its own perfection. Since knowledge is the ultimate perfection of our soul, in which resides our ultimate happiness, we are all therefore by nature subject to a desire for it.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	As the Philosopher (for antonomasia, it does not need to be cited) says, Aristotle, at the beginning of (his) Metaphysics, all men naturally desire to know. The reason for this fact (the desire to know) can be and is that everything, pushed by its nature where the divine providence acts, tends to his own perfection (to make fully what it has in it power), so as science (knowledge) is the last (extreme) perfection of our soul, which is our last (highest) happiness, all are by nature subject (prepared) to desire it.<br />
	2. <em>Many are, however, deprived of this most noble perfection by various causes within and outside of man which remove him from the habit of knowledge.</em><br />
	However many are deprived from this most noble perfection, the achievement of knowledge, for different reasons, that (being) within man and outside of it prevent him from reaching the science (they distance him from the disposition to science).<br />
	3. <em>Within man there exist two kinds of defects which impede him, one pertaining to the body, the other to the soul. That pertaining to the body occurs when its parts are not properly disposed, so that it can receive nothing, as is the case with the deaf, the dumb, and the like. That pertaining to the soul occurs when malice overcomes it, so that it becomes the follower of vicious pleasures, by which it is so deceived that because of them it degrades the worth of all things.</em><br />
	Inside man there may be two defects and impediments: one from the part of the body, the other on the side of the soul. The defect in the body is when the organs are poorly shaped so that (the body) can not perceive anything, as well as in the deaf and dumb, and in others with similar defects (physical defects that isolate man from communication with others). The defect in the soul is when in it prevails the malice (the disposition to evil), so that (the soul) begins to follow vicious pleasures, in which it is so deceived, that due of these pleasures despises anything else.<br />
	4. <em>Likewise outside of man two causes may be discerned, one of which subjects him to necessity, the other to indolence. The first consists of domestic and civic responsibilities, which properly engage the greater number of men, so that they are permitted no time for contemplation. The other is the handicap that derives from the place where a person is born and bred, which at times will not only lack a university but be far removed from the company of educated persons.</em><br />
	Outside of man can be similarly identified two causes, one of which determines the need (to deprive yourself of knowledge), the other (causes) laziness. The first is the commitment to their family and to their city, which dutifully keeps (occupied) a large number of men, so that they can not have free time (commitments) for intellectual activity. The other (cause) is the shortcoming of the place where the person was born and raised, not only devoid of any educational institution (the University), but far (even) from educated people.<br /></p>

<p>5. <em>Two of these causes, namely the first from within and the first from outside, are not to be blamed but excused and are deserving of pardon; the other two, although one more than the other, deserve our censure and scorn.</em><br />
	Two of these causes, that is, the first part of the inside of man and the first part of the outside of man (the fault of the bodily organs and caring family and civil), are not to rebuke, but to excuse and worthy of forgiveness, the other two, although it is one of the most (malice), are worthy of blame (disapproval) and abomination (feeling of deep aversion).<br />
	6. <em>Anyone therefore can plainly see upon careful reflection that there remain few who are capable of achieving the habit of knowledge desired by all, and that the handicapped who live forever starved of this food are almost too numerous to count.</em><br />
	Clearly therefore, can see, who well-considered, that there are few who remain that can reach to the habit (to disposal) of science, and many (almost innumerable) are those that are prevented who remain hungry for this food (it is the beginning of the metaphor that dominates the whole work).<br />
	7. <em>Blessed are the few who sit at the table where the bread of the angels is eaten, and most unfortunate those who share the food of sheep!</em><br />
	Oh, blessed are those few (real scholars) who sit at the table where the bread of angels is eaten (there feeds on the divine and human wisdom)! and poor those who share the same food with the sheep!<br />
	8. <em>But since man is by nature a friend of all men, and every friend is grieved by defects found in the one he loves, they who are fed at so lofty a table are not without compassion toward those whom they see grazing about on grass and acorns in animal pastures.</em><br />
	But as each man to another man is by nature friend, and (because) every friend complains of the imperfection of the one who loves (his friend), those who eat at so high (noble) table (the bread of angels, divine wisdom), have mercy on those who they see eat (go around eating) grass and acorns as grazing animals, those who live in ignorance.<br />
	9. <em>And since compassion is the mother of generosity, they who possess knowledge always give liberally of their great riches to the truly poor and are like a living fountain by whose waters the natural thirst referred to above is quenched.</em><br />
	And as mercy (pity), is the source of doing good, educated people always generously donate their good wealth to real poor (people with no knowledge) and are almost a source of life, the water which quenches the thirst natural (the thirst for wisdom) named above.<br />
	10. <em>Therefore I, who do not sit at the blessed table, but, having fled the pasture of the common herd, gather up a part of what falls to the feet of those who do sit there, and who know the unfortunate life of those I have left behind, for the sweetness that I taste in what I gather up piece by piece, and moved by compassion, though not forgetting myself, have set aside for those who are unfortunate something that I placed before their eyes some time ago, by which I have increased their desire.</em><br />
	And I, therefore, that I do not sit at the blessed table (the one of wisdom), but escaped from ignorance, (standing) at the feet of those who sit (at the table) pick (the crumbs) of what falls from them, and I know the miserable lives of those I left behind, for the sweetness that I feel that little by little I take, moved by mercy, without forgetting my earlier state of ignorance, I put aside for the poor some things (my songs), I have already shown in their eyes for some time ago (the songs were in fact already been published and known); and in this I made them more eager.</p>

<p>11. <em>Wishing now to set their table, I intend to present to all men a banquet of what I have shown them and of the bread which must necessarily accompany such meat, without which it could not be consumed by them.</em><br />
	So now wanting to prepare the table for them (the poor), I intend to make a general convivio (banquet) with the things I showed them (in the past, the songs) and with the bread that is required for such a dish (the main dish), without which it could not be eaten by them.<br />
	12. <em>This banquet, being worthy of such bread, offers meat which I intend should not be served in vain. Therefore I would not have anyone be seated there whose organs are ill-disposed because he lacks teeth, tongue, or palate, nor anyone addicted to vice, for his stomach is so full of poisonous and contrary humors that it would not be able to retain my meat.</em><br />
	And this (book) is that banquet, (made) of the bread (comment) worthy (fit) with which the meat (my songs) do not intend to administered in vain. So do not come near anyone who has physical defects (which are inside man, mentioned above as deafness and muteness that isolate him to the communication) because he has no teeth, tongue and palate (needed to eat it, in the metaphor of the banquet is indicated the defect of the organ of mastication), neither (to sit at my banquet) any follower of vices (the defect inside the man from the soul, the malice), because his stomach is full of moods (juices) poisonous opposed to digestion, so that no dish could assimilate.<br />
	13. <em>But let come here all those whose human hunger derives from domestic or civic responsibilities, and let them sit at the same table with others likewise handicapped; and at their feet let all those place themselves who do not merit a higher seat because of their indolence; and let each group partake of my meat with bread, for I will have them both taste of it and digest it.</em><br />
	Come here instead (to my banquet, to me) anyone left in the desire to know, that is worthy of men, due of the care (commitment) of their own family or their city (defect outside of man), and sit at the same table with others who have suffered the same impediment; and place themselves at their feet all those who remained inactive for laziness (a second defect outside of man) who are not worthy to sit higher up (and even at the same level as civil or family commitment prevented): and the ones and the others take my meat with bread, that will taste and digest.<br />
	14. <em>The meat of this banquet will be prepared in fourteen ways: that is, in fourteen canzoni, whose subject is both love as well as virtue. By lacking the present bread they possessed some degree of obscurity, so that to many their beauty was more pleasing than their goodness.</em><br />
	The food of this banquet, will be composed of fourteen courses, that is fourteen songs (the final act will be, however, only three) whose matter is both love as virtue, which without this bread (this comment), had a shadow of darkness, so that many (who knew the songs already published) tasted more of their beauty that the quality of the subject (the real meaning).<br />
	15. <em>But this bread (that is, the present explanation) will be the light that renders visible every shade of their meaning.</em><br />
	But this bread, that is the present explanation, will be the light that renders every shade of their meaning.</p>

<p>16. <em>If in the present work, which is called The Banquet, as I wish it to be, the subject is treated more maturely than in the Vita Nuova, I do not intend by this in any way to disparage that book but rather more greatly to support it with this one, seeing that it understandably suits that one to be fervid and passionate, and this one tempered and mature</em><br />
	And if in this work, which is named Convivio and I want to honor its name, it discusses more maturely than in the Vita Nuova (earlier work by Dante), than does not mean, however, I do not fail that in any (no) part, but be of any benefit with this (work, Convivio), seeing, as a reason, it agrees that the one is fervid (burning) and passionate (full of passion), and this one temperate (moderate) and mature.<br />
	17. <em>For it is proper to speak and act differently at different ages, because certain manners are fitting and praiseworthy at one age which at another are unbecoming and blameworthy, as will be shown below with appropriate reasoning in the fourth book. I wrote the former work at the threshold of my youth, and this one after I had already passed through it.</em><br />
	As an age is convenient to speak and act differently than another (age) and because certain behaviors are appropriate and laudable at an age (the one youthful) that are (becomes) dishonorable and blameworthy to another (the one maturity); are things as later in the fourth treatise of this book, will be shown properly. And I in the earlier work (Vita Nuova), I spoke as I came in my youth, and in this next (Convivio), spoke after it passed.<br />
	18. <em id="bookI_ChapterI_18" >Since my true meaning was other than what the previously mentioned canzoni outwardly reveal, I intend to explain these canzoni by means of an allegorical exposition, after having discussed the literal account, so that both arguments will be savored by those who have been invited to this supper.</em><br />
	And since my true intention was different from that which apparently show the songs, of which I said, I intend to explain those songs with an allegorical representation, exposed after the literal explanation, so that the one and the other interpretation will give taste to those who are invited to this supper.<br />
	19. <em>And if the banquet does not fulfill their expectations, I ask them to attribute every shortcoming not to my will but to my capability; for here it is my desire to be a disciple of complete and loving generosity.</em><br />
	Which (invited) I pray everyone that, if the banquet proves not so splendid as befits its call (less then what I'm promising), impute defects not to my will, but to my (limited) capacity, because my intention here is follower of a complete and dear generosity.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Chapter II</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em id="bookI_ChapterII_1">At the beginning of every well-ordered banquet the servants customarily take the bread placed on the table and cleanse it of any impurity. So I, who stand in their place in the present work, intend first of all to cleanse two impurities from this exposition, which passes for bread in my provision.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	At the beginning of every well-ordered banquet, the servants are expected to take the bread placed on the table  and clean up of any stain. So I, that in this writing I carry out the function of those (the servants), I intend to clean primarily by two spots this exposure, which in my banquet has the function of the bread.<br />
	2. <em>The first is that for someone to speak of himself seems impermissible; the other is that to speak of matters by going into them too deeply seems unreasonable; and in this way the knife of my judgment will strip away the impermissible and the unreasonable.</em><br />
	The first spot is that it seems no reasonable that an author talk too much about himself, the other (scrub to clean) is that in an explanation seems unreasonable (nonsense) make reasonings (which look) too deep (hard); my keen judgment clean in this form (this way) the non-permissible (talk too much about oneself) and not reasonable (the reasoning apparently too difficult). Dante continues in the banquet metaphor, comparing himself to the attendant who cleans the still stained bread with a knife.</p>

<p>12. <em>To return to the main topic, however, I say that (as touched on above) speaking about oneself is allowed in cases of necessity, and among the several cases of necessity two are very evident.</em><br />
	Actually, going back to the main topic (in the preceding paragraphs omitted, Dante discussed the non-opportunity of self-praise and self-reproach), I say, as before has been touched, as and when it granted to talk about oneself for necessity; and among the necessary causes are two the most evident.<br />
	13. <em>One is when great infamy or danger cannot be avoided except by talking about oneself; then it is permissible, for the reason that to take the less evil of two paths is almost the same as taking a good one. This necessity moved Boethius to speak of himself, so that under the pretext of consolation he might defend himself against the perpetual infamy of his exile, by showing it to be unjust, since no other apologist came forward.</em><br /> 
	One (cause that allows talk about oneself) is when without think of oneself can not dismiss great danger or infamy; and then is allowed (speaking of oneself) for the reason that take the less bad of two paths is as (almost) take the good one. And this necessity Boethius moves to speak about himself, because under the pretext (the motivation not true) of the consolation he defend himself against the perpetual infamy of his exile, by showing it was unfair, because no one defended him.<br />
	14. <em>The other arises when by speaking of oneself very great benefit comes to another by way of instruction; and this reason moved Augustine to speak of himself in his Confessions, because by the progress of his life, which proceeded from bad to good, good to better, and better to best, he gave us an example and instruction which could not be provided by any other testimony so true as this.</em><br />
	The other (cause that allows speaking of oneself) is when through the way of doctrine (of instruction) comes a great utility in the other; and this reason moves Augustine to speak of himself in his Confessions, because in the progress of his life, which was from not good to good, good to better, and better to best, he gave example and doctrine (instruction), that could not be get by any other true testimony as this.<br />
	15. <em>Consequently, if each of these reasons may serve as my excuse, the bread made from my wheat is sufficiently cleansed of its first impurity. A fear of infamy moves me, and a desire to give instruction moves me, which in truth others are unable to give.</em><br />
	So, if I am exonerated from the one and the other reason, the bread of my wheat is sufficiently cleaned up of the first spot (speaking of myself). Moves me the fear of infamy and moves me the desire to give doctrine (instruction), which, in truth, others could not give.<br />
	16. <em>I fear the infamy of having yielded myself to the great passion that anyone who reads the canzoni mentioned above must realize once ruled me. This infamy will altogether cease as I speak now about myself and show that my motivation was not passion but virtue.</em><br />
	I fear the infamy that had prevailed in me to follow the great passion (for another woman), as anyone who reads the songs named above could imagine; which infamy ceases, entirely, as I speak now about myself and show that not passion but virtue was the reason that moved me (to speak about myself).<br />
	Dante fears the accusation that it is believed that he left Beatrice for the passion of another woman, and therefore the infamy of being a rhymer of love capable only of passing from one love to another.<br />
	17. <em>I intend also to show the true meaning of the canzoni, which no one can perceive unless I reveal it, because it is hidden beneath the figure of allegory. This will not only bring true delight to the ear but as well useful instruction concerning both this mode of speaking and this mode of understanding the writings of others.</em><br />
	I intend also to show the true meaning of those (songs), that anyone (no one) can see (perceive) if (unless) I do not tell it, because it is hidden under the figure of allegory: and this not only give pleasure to hearing, but (as well) useful instruction, and to (be able to) speak and understand the writings of others in that way (according to the allegory).<br />
	The allegorical explanation not only absolves Dante from the accusation of infidelity to Beatrice, because it will be clear who is hiding behind this new woman, but it is also teaching to be able to read the scriptures.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Chapter III</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em>Deserving of severe censure is that action which, while intended to remove some defect, itself introduces it, like the man who was sent to break up a quarrel, and before breaking it up began another.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	It deserves of many reproaches that action, which prepared to remove some defect, causes the same defect by itself; as (would be worthy of reprimand) one who sent to break up a quarrel, and before breaking it up, he began another.<br />
	2. <em>Now that my bread has been cleansed on the one side, it is necessary for me to cleanse it on the other to escape a censure of this kind, for my writing, which can almost be called a commentary, is intended to remove the defect of the canzoni mentioned above, and this may itself prove to be perhaps a little difficult in part. This difficulty is deliberate here so as to escape a greater defect, and is not due to a lack of knowledge.</em><br />
	And since my bread (the comment) was cleaned by a first charge (speaking of himself), it is necessary to clean it on the other, to escape the following reproach, that my writing, which can almost be called a commentary, is arranged to remove the defect of the songs mentioned above (the defect of the lack of comprehension of the songs), but it may be itself in any part a little difficult. This difficulty was intended to escape a major defect, not out of ignorance.<br />
	3. <em>Ah, if only it had pleased the Maker of the Universe that the cause of my apology had never existed, for then neither would others have sinned against me, nor would I have suffered punishment unjustly–the punishment, I mean, of exile and poverty.</em><br />
	Ah, had pleased who rule the universe (God) that the cause of my excuse (exile) had never been! Because (if God had wanted) no one would wrong against me, nor I would have suffered punishment unjustly, I mean, (the punishment) of exile and poverty.<br />
	4. <em>Since it was the pleasure of the citizens of the most beautiful and famous daughter of Rome, Florence, to cast me out of her sweet bosom–where I was born and bred up to the pinnacle of my life, and where, with her good will, I desire with all my heart to rest my weary mind and to complete the span of time that is given to me–I have traveled like a stranger, almost like a beggar, through virtually all the regions to which this tongue of ours extends, displaying against my will the wound of fortune for which the wounded one is often unjustly accustomed to be held accountable.</em><br />
	Since pleased the citizens of the beautiful and famous daughter of Rome, Florence, to chase me out to her sweet bosom, - where I was born and I was fed up to the age of maturity of my life, and in which (breast), with her (city, Florence) consent, I wish with all my heart to rest my weary mind and end the years of my life -, I have travelled as pilgrim (I wandered as a stranger), almost begging, in almost all the parts where the Italian language is spoken, showing against my will the wound inflicted by fortune, that many times want to unfairly blame those wounded.<br />
	5. <em>Truly I have been a ship without sail or rudder, brought to different ports, inlets, and shores by the dry wind that painful poverty blows. And I have appeared before the eyes of many who perhaps because of some report had imagined me in another form. In their sight not only was my person held cheap, but each of my works was less valued, those already completed as much as those yet to come.</em><br />
	I really have been a ship without sail and without rudder, brought to different ports, inlets and beaches by the dry wind that painful poverty blows, and I have appeared (in this miserable condition) in the eyes of many, who perhaps for some (good) reputation had imagined me differently, in front of whom (many) appears not only my person more vile, but makes less valuable each (my) work, those already completed as well as those (yet) to come.<br />
	The hardness of the comment, the style high and difficult, it is necessary to return to Dante the dignity compromised by exile.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Chapter V</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em id="bookI_ChapterV_1">Now that this bread is cleansed of its accidental impurities, it remains to apologize for one pertaining to substance, that is, for its being in the vernacular and not in Latin; which is to say, by way of metaphor, for its being made of oats and not of wheat.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	As this bread (commentary) was clean from <a href="#bookI_ChapterII_1">accidental spots</a> (not related to the thing in itself, something added to), it remains to justify it by a substantial (of its substance, of what is made), that is, from being in the vernacular (vulgar) and not in Latin, which is to say, by similarity, bread made of oats (made by cereals of lesser value, rye, barley, etc.) and not of wheat.<br />  
	Accident refers to the condition of a thing, substance, to the matter of a thing, the accidental spots (impurities) of bread (comment), already fully explained, are speak about himself and its hardness.<br />
	2. <em>This impurity is excused in few words for three reasons which have moved me to choose this language rather than the other: the first arises from precaution against creating an inappropriate relationship; the next from zealous generosity; the third from natural love of one’s native tongue.</em><br />
	And from this accusation (vulgar is bread of oats, that is being of less value than Latin) shortly remove three reasons which have moved me to choose this language and not the other: the first comes from the prudence against creating an inappropriate relationship, the next from a prompt and spontaneous generosity, the third from natural love of one's native tongue.</p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Chapter VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em>Now complete generosity may be observed in three things which are a consequence of using the vernacular and which would not have been a consequence of using Latin. The first is giving to many; the second is giving useful things; the third is giving a gift without its being asked.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	It can then recognize the full generosity in three elements (things), which are consequently the choice of the vernacular and would not be consequential choosing Latin. The first thing is giving to many, the second is givìng useful things, the third is giving the gift without its being asked.<br />
	2. <em>It is good to give to and to help one, but it is complete goodness to give to and to help many in that it resembles the beneficence of God, who is the most universal benefactor.</em><br />
	Since give to one and prove to be useful to is good, but give to many and benefit to many is complete goodness, because it takes example by the gifts (benefits) of God, which is the most universal benefactor.<br /></p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Chapter XI</h2>
</div>
<p>1. <em>To the perpetual disgrace and humiliation of those contemptible men of Italy who praise the vernacular of others and disparage their own, I say that their impulse arises from five detestable causes.<my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref></em><br />
	To eternal infamy and humiliation of the wicked Italian who praise the vernacular of others and despise their own, I say that their attitude is descended from five causes morally reprehensible.<br />
	2. <em>The first is blindness in discernment; the second, disingenuous excusing; the third, desire for glory; the fourth, reasoning prompted by envy; the fifth and last, baseness of mind, that is, pusillanimity. Each of these faults has so great a following that few are those who are free from them.</em><br />
	The first (cause) is the blindness of (inability to) discernment, the second, malice in excuses, the third, unbridled desire of foolish and immoral glory, the fourth, a pretext for their envy, the fifth and final, baseness of mind, that is cowardice. And each of these culprits things, is so full of followers, that few are those who are free from them.</p>

<p>3. <em>Of the first we may reason as follows. Just as the sensitive part of the soul has eyes by which it apprehends the difference in things with respect to their external coloring, so the rational part has its own eye by which it apprehends the difference in things with respect to how they are directed to some end: and this is discernment.</em><br />
	Of to the first cause (inability to discern) you can reason in this way. Just the sensitive part of the soul has its eyes, by which it perceive (and learn) the difference of things thanks to the fact that they have colored, in the same way the rational part has its own eye, by which it perceives the difference of things as they tend to a specific order, and this is the ability to discern (discretion).<br />
	4. <em>Also, just as he who is blind in the eyes of sense always follows others in judging what is good and what is evil, so he who is blind to the light of discernment always follows the popular cry in his judgment, whether true or false. And so whenever the one who cries is blind, he and the other who leans upon him, being likewise blind, must come to a bad end. For this reason it is written that “if the blind lead the blind, so shall they both fall into the ditch.”</em><br />
	And as one who is blind in the eyes always follows (by necessity) driving other walking or bad or good (according to the guide), so he who is blind of the light (capability) of discernment always follows in his judgments the common opinion, either true or false; so that whenever the guide is blind (in error), it is inevitable that they go to a bad end so the driver as he, himself blind, that he leans upon him. So it is written that: "the blind lead the blind, and so shall both fall into the pit."<br />
	The last sentence is of the Gospel of Matthew XV, 14.<br />
	...<br />
	9. <em>These people should be called sheep, not men, for if a sheep were to cast itself over a cliff a thousand feet high, all the others would follow after it; and if while crossing the road a sheep for any reason leaps, all the others leap, even though they see nothing to leap over.</em><br />
	These one (people without discernment, those who do not see) deserve to be called sheep and not men; as if a sheep throw itself from a cliff thousand feet high, all the others would go behind it; and if a sheep crossing a road for any reason jumps, also all the others jump, even though they do not see any obstacle to leap over.<br />
	10. <em>I have seen many jump into a well after one that jumped in, perhaps believing that they were jumping over a wall, even though the shepherd, weeping and shouting, tried to check them with this arms and body.</em><br />
	Indeed in the past I've seen many (sheeps) jump into a well for one that jumped in, perhaps believing that they were jumping over a wall, although the shepherd, crying and shouting, was put in front of them with his arms and chest (with his whole body).<br /></p>

<div class="page-header">
	<h2 class="content">Chapter XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>11. <em>So turning our gaze backwards and gathering together the reasons already noted, we can see that this bread, with which the canzoni placed below must be eaten, is sufficiently cleansed of its impurities and of being oaten. Therefore it is time to think of serving the meat.</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref><br />
	So turning back the look, and gathering together the reasons before exposed (in this first book), can be considered this bread, with which the songs listed below must be eaten, being adequately cleaned from its spots (impurities) and (the charge of) being of lower quality (made of oats grain, poor quality compared to wheat, that is, out of metaphor, refuting the charge that the vernacular is of lesser value than the Latin); therefore it is time to take care to administer the food (the songs, according to the metaphor already widely used).<br />
	12. <em id="bookI_ChapterXIII_12">This commentary shall be that bread made with barley by which thousands shall be satiated, and my baskets shall be full to overflowing with it. This shall be a new light, a new sun which shall rise where the old sun shall set and which shall give light to those who lie in shadows and in darkness because the old sun no longer sheds its light upon them.</em><br />
	This (commentary in vernacular) shall be the bread of barley by which thousands shall be satiated, and to me shall be left the baskets overflowing with it. This (commentary in  vernacular) shall be new light and new sun, which shall arise where the usual one fade, and shall give light to those who are in shadows and in darkness owing the fact that the usual (old) sun (other texts in Latin, by contemporary authors of Dante) does not give them light.</p>
