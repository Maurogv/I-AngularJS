<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy">Comedy</a> is a song in which Dante, the author and protagonist of the book, he finds himself, halfway through his life, suddenly, and without knowing why, in a dark forest. Lost, the teacher who had instructed him in poetry appears, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Virgil</a>, called by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Portinari">Beatrice</a>, beloved by the poet in his youth and then died young, latest in a chain of women running from Maria. Virgil is offered as a guide to lead Dante on a journey of atonement through the underworld by visiting the dead souls, alerting that he can lead him to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)">Inferno</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatorio">Purgatorio</a>, but not in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradiso_(Dante)">Paradiso</a> for his lack of faith, to which Dante will be led by soul more worthy of him.<br />
	Dante and Virgil meet the sinners of Hell, condemned for eternity, going down in an inverted cone divided into nine circles according to the vice and sin until the absolute evil, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Lucifer</a>. Through the navel of the devil, from a cavity the two pilgrims come out from the opposite side of the earth's crust where rises the mountain of Purgatory. Here they meet new sinners, who pay for an inclination towards vice or a grave sin of which in life they have manifested a repentance. The punishment lasts according to the time they have sinned down here and then they can climb this mountain. In front of a celestial figure, the porter of Purgatory, there are three phases of repentance: awareness of the evil committed, confession in words, satisfaction by means of works. Dante himself is lightned of his sins along the nine frames. On top of Purgatory, an imaginary Earthly Paradise, Virgil is replaced by Beatrice, who forces Dante to repent, who in tears admits his sins, a necessary condition to lead him to Heaven.<br />
	The poet crosses the nine skies of Heaven. Here he meets many saints of the Catholic Church, who freely loved their neighbor, and the verses are one of the highest praises to God. In the last canto, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux with a prayer to the Virgin Mary introduces Dante, now without sin, to the Empire where God is, for the final meeting, the purpose of the journey. He sees three circles of equal size and different colors, then sees a human figure in the second circle. While admitting the inability to explain the Incarnation of the Son, Dante is kidnapped by an ecstasy that ceases the power of high fantasy. The last verse of the Comedy, <em>the love that moves the sun and the other stars</em> closes the journey started <em>in the middle of the journey of our life</em>.</p>

<p>The Comedy is a poem divided into three parts, Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso, composed in cantos (songs), thirty four to Hell of which the first considered prologue, thirty three to Purgatory and Heaven, for a total of one hundred, the songs are in triplets hendecasyllables.<br />
	In Convivio, Dante explained how the sense are to be found in a poetic text, identifyng them up to a number of four, literal, allegorical, moral, anagogical, all present in the Comedy. Strong is the allegory throughout the poem, the dark forest represents the sin, Dante is himself and every man.</p>

<p>High and popular, Comedy influence for over seven hundred years the poetry and art with brilliant inventions, words in music. It lives because the <i>Poem Sacred, to which both heaven and earth have set their hands</i> is the journey that a man undertakes to escape from evil, visiting the afterlife, in three days, a kingdom that many wonder how it will be. Dante does not invent it, by grace he illustrates the existing one. It has been, is and will be regulated by God, in which the word of him is contained in the Bible. God made man in the likeness of him, but free. For Christians, the incarnation of the Son of God with his death on the cross and resurrection redeemed the world. <br />
	The narration in Dante's geometric universe is a succession of episodes and encounters. It is fueled by the dialogue and complicity between student and teacher and by the freedom of the dual role of protagonist of the journey and author of the book. Extraordinary is the ability with which Dante in a few verses outlines the characters of the Comedy, with memorable dialogues. Besides, he isolates themes, and the discussion of Fortuna comes to mind. And it is amazing how each canto can be read independently, despite the fact that it is unique for the overall structure of the Comedy.<br />
	At the center of the canticles, the poet's passions: civil love for Florence, the <i>fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered</i>, politics and love for a woman. They will be betrayed by life: Beatrice dies young, the adverse political part of his city, the Blacks of the Guelph side, condemn him to death and he is forced to wander as an exile to earn his bread; despite the hope he will not return to his hometown. Still, Dante progresses as a man and a poet. He outlines his vision of the world: there are two powers that are indispensable for each other; but the Catholic Church is corrupt and there is no state power capable of governing.</p>

<p>Memorable some verses and characters, which I can not fail to mention and because it will be the sound itself to tell. Inferno, Canto I, 1-3: <em>In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself, in a dark wood, for the direct way was lost</em><my-ref>^</my-ref> and all the rest of the canto.<my-ref>^</my-ref> Gate of Hell, Canto, III 1-9: <em>'Through me the way to the city dolent, through me the way to eternal dole, through me the way among the people lost. Justice moved my high factor, created me the divine potency, the highest wisdom and the primal love. Before me there were no created things, only eterne, and I eternal last. All hope abandon, all you that enter in!'</em>.<my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref> Canto V<my-ref>^</my-ref> with Minos, Paolo and Francesca, and Ulysses and his words in XXVI, 118-120: <em>'Consider your seed, you were not made to live like brutes, but for pursuit virtue and knowledge'</em>.<my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref> Canto XXXIII, 1, Count Ugolino and Archishop Ruggieri: <em>His mouth uplifted from his savage meal</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref> and many others.<br />
	Purgatory, XVII 127-142, the last words of Virgil: <em>'The temporal fire and the eternal, you have seen son, and have reached a place where I, by myself, farther I can no discern. By intellect and art I here have brought you, your pleasure take for the guide henceforth, beyond the steep ways and the art you are. Behold the sun, that shines upon your forehead, behold the grass, the flowers, and the shrubs which of itself alone this land produces. Until rejoicing come the beauty eyes which weeping made me to come to you, you can sit down and go among them. Do not expect more word or sign from me, free, upright and whole is your free-will, and foul were it not to do its sense; by that over yourself, I crown you and mitre you.'</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref> The song of the three Theological Virtues addressed to Beatrice, in Purgatory, XXXI 133-145: <em>'Turn Beatrice, turn your holy eyes', was their song, 'to your faithfull one who, has to see you, take so many steps! By grace, grace us that you unveil your mounth to him, so that he may discern the second beauty you that you conceal.' O splendour of the living eternal light, who has grown pale underneath the shadow of Parnassus, or drunk at its cistern, that would not seem to have his mind encumbered, trying to render you as you appeared, where in harmony sky overshadow you, when in open air you loosed?</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref> and many others.</p>

<p>As I am going to tell my story, unfortunate, a brief introduction to the book that kidnapped me in my youth could not be missing. I read nothing but Dante every day. The Italian language sounds so good. I wanted to learn and there are fragments of Greek and Latin history, and I would have liked to have studied them in school. By fantasy he surpasses all, equal to Homer. It deals with essential matters of existence with simplicity, and I am not familiar with philosophy. I do not tire of reading the Comedy because the author is the brave protagonist, a man who in danger and fear clings to the dear master of poetry and to the Christian faith. The great poet guides me among the stories of men in his vision of the world, where there is the Gospel and the certainty of God; so he re-educates me to the faith. Not having cultivated it, it is forgotten. I learn by heart the poem because it's a song; reciting I listen to my voice and standing up my back hurts less.</p>
