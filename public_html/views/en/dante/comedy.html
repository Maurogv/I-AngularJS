<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy">Comedy</a> is a song in which Dante, author and protagonist of the book, finds himself, in the middle of his life, suddenly and without knowing why, in a dark forest. Lost appears to him that the teacher had instructed him to poetry, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Virgil</a>, called by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Portinari">Beatrice</a>,
    beloved by the poet in his youth and then died young, latest in a chain of women running from Maria. Virgil is offered as a guide to lead Dante on a journey of atonement through the underworld by visiting the dead souls, alerting the pilgrim that he can lead him to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)">Hell</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatorio">Purgatory</a>, but not in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradiso_(Dante)">Heaven</a> for his lack of faith, to which Dante will be led by soul more worthy of him.<br />
    Dante and Virgil meet the sinners of Hell, in which sins are eternal, going down in an inverted cone divided into nine circles according to the vice and sin until the absolute evil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, to exit in Purgatory represented as a mountain. Here they meet new sinners, in which sins less serious than those of the sinners of Hell are purified with taking consciousness of evil committed, repentance and serve the sentence and the subsequent ascent of the mountain, as Dante himself who is lightened from his sins along the nine rounds. On top of Purgatory, Virgil is replaced by Beatrice, forcing Dante to repentance, a necessary condition to take him to heaven.<br />
    The poet through the cornices of Paradise, free from sin comes in the light of Christ incarnate, mystery of humanity, and here the force of Dante, his high fantasy, runs out in his vision. The last verse of the Comedy, <em>the love that moves the sun and the other stars</em> return to the first, <em>in the middle of the journey of our life</em>, in the circularity of the poem, the melody of a song without end.</p>

<p>The Comedy is a poem divided into three parts, Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise, composed in cantos (songs), thirty four to Hell of which the first considered prologue, thirty three to Purgatory and Paradise, for a total of one hundred, the songs are in triplets hendecasyllables.<br />
    In Convivio explained how the sense are to be found in a poetic text, identifyng them up to a number of four, literal, allegorical, moral, anagogical.<br />
    Strong is the allegory throughout the poem, the dark forest represents the sin, Dante is the ego, the every one representing humanity.</p>

<p>Noble and popular, the Comedy, the work of a Christian influence poetry, art going in life for over seven hundred years with brilliant inventions, music, words, sense apparent and deep, moral and religious as knowledge of good and evil, and redemption of man.<br />
    The journey, being at the same time the book author and protagonist of the journey, the relationship between the pupil and the teacher, that one between the poet and the new guide, the meeting and dialogue with characters whose voice is always that of the narrator, the pauses, allow the poet to open constantly new situations, corners, gradients, outlining his vision of the world that by the grace the poet can reveal.<br />
    On the one hand the passions of the poet, the civil love for his city Florence and his nation Italy, for politics, the love for a woman, the other his condition of exile from Florence and forced to wander to earn his bread, are driving in his reflection. The protagonist is always the man with his own actions and choices, claim or submission of which the poet is faithful narrator whose natural empathy for humans is often overwhelmed and overturned. Continuous is the comparison with his present world, corrupt and degraded by the Church and by a state unable to govern. The synthesis capacity of the poet defines the characters of the Commedia often in a few verses, short lines, while others require a more complex story, inside the geometric universe of Comedy of which are part of it and build it, as every theme that emerges so well distinguished in the thread that ties all songs themselves and to the work overall, allowing a reading independent for each canto.<br />
    Dante does not invent a universe, illustrates the existing one, which has been, is and will be, governed by God, with the natural laws, his word in the Bible, his infinite love, of which man is always in the center, similar to God, able to receive and return his love. The verses of the poem are a real praise to God, the figure of Christ that appears and disappears, is the presence in the background of every page of Comedy, light in which run out the journey granted to Dante by grace that lack his strength, the high fantasy, Christ extreme mystery of inexplicable love also for the poet.</p>
<p>Memorable some verses and characters, verses that are the Comedy, that I cannot not mention, many in Hell, the Canto I 1-3 <em>In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself, in a dark wood, for the direct way was lost</em><my-ref>^</my-ref> and all the canto I<my-ref>^</my-ref>, Gate of Hell Canto III 1-9 <em>&quot;Through me the way to the city dolent, through me the way to eternal dole, through me the way among the people lost. Justice moved my high factor, created me the divine potency, the highest wisdom and the primal love. Before me there were no created things, only eterne, and I eternal last. All hope abandon, all you that enter in!&quot;</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref> then the song V<my-ref>^</my-ref> with Minos, Paolo and Francesca, to Ulysses and his words in XXVI 118-120 <em>Consider your seed, you were not made to live like brutes, but for pursuit virtue and knowledge</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref>, Count Ugolino and Archishop Ruggieri canto XXXIII 1 <span id="result_box1" class="short_text" lang="en"><em>His mouth uplifted from his savage meal</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref> and many others.<br />
    In Purgatory in the last words of Virgil, Purgatory XVII 127-142 <em>&quot;The temporal fire and the eternal, you have seen son, and have reached a place where I, by myself, farther I can no discern. By intellect and art I here have brought you, your pleasure take for the guide henceforth, beyond the steep ways and the art you are. Behold the sun, that shines upon your forehead, behold the grass, the flowers, and the shrubs which of itself alone this land produces. Until rejoicing come the beauty eyes which weeping made me to come to you, you can sit down and go among them. Do not expect more word or sign from me, free, upright and whole is your free-will, and foul were it not to do its sense; by that over yourself, I crown you and mitre you.&quot;</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref>, the song of the three Theological Virtues addressed to Beatrice, In Purgatory XXXI 133-145 <em>&quot;Turn Beatrice, turn your holy eyes&quot;, was their song, &quot;to your faithfull one who, has to see you, take so many steps! By grace, grace us that you unveil your mounth to him, so that he may discern the second beauty you that you conceal&quot;. O splendour of the living eternal light, who has grown pale underneath the shadow of Parnassus, or drunk at its cistern, that would not seem to have his mind encumbered, trying to render you as you appeared, where in harmony sky overshadow you, when in open air you loosed?</em><my-ref>^</my-ref><my-ref>^</my-ref> and many others.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to deepen Comedy, &#39;I will use&#39; when I will be some flash in the drafting of this site, verses that always accompanied me in my life as young or as adult, as a lover of words, rules of composition of sentences, relationship between them and their musicality. And in my condition, sometimes as ill, the one who is sick or hurt and seeks the good, or feeling better, but also as walker, runner, explorer, scholar, from the one who does not want to be away from the banquet of truth. The verses and the triplets will be examined for the literal sense and meaning within the Comedy and in the context in which they are mentioned by me.</p>
