<p>As a young man I liked to read, often were books of fiction and poetry, many authors made ​​reference cited, paying homage always to the same great poet. Aware that hardly great writers and poets could be wrong, I delayed the reading of the great poet to stay still in the shadow of the other authors to deepen him further. Dante had studied in school, but I did not remember anything, maybe I was not even impressed. I am reminded of those great writers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky">Dostoyevsky</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Montale">Montale</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giosuè_Carducci">Carducci</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Foscolo">Foscolo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Gadda">Gadda</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Porta">Porta</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Leopardi">Leopardi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Manzoni">Manzoni</a>. I remember that Giacomo Leopardi wrote in the Canti II On the Monument of Dante<my-ref>^</my-ref>, <em>the one for which the meonio cantor is not alone</em> just comparing Dante to the Meonia poet, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer</a>, or of Alessandro Manzoni that says <em>to wash clothes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno">Arno</a></em> before the final draft of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Betrothed_(Manzoni_novel)">Betrothed novel</a>.</p>
<p>My knowledge of Dante began with the reading of his early works, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_vulgari_eloquentia">De Vulgari eloquentia</a>, written in Latin and by me read in Italian, in which he claimed the dignity of the vernacular, followed by Convivio.</p>
<p><a href="#introductiontoConvivio">Convivio</a> impressed me, argoments were all new to me, different in style and meaning from those read in the authors known to me, the beginning that surprises for the beauty and then keeps the promise, anticipation and preparation for <a href="#comedy">Comedy</a>.</p>
