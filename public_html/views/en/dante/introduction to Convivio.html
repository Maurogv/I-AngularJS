<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convivio">Convivio</a> is a banquet of knowledge in the vernacular written by Dante Alighieri, approximately between 1304 and 1307; it consists of four treatises, the first of an unfinished work. Dante establishes this table because he could not fail to tell the extraordinary feeling that has matured in him, which he expressed in songs.To be appreciated not only for beauty, songs require a comment, which is knowledge. In fact, it explains how it is possible that two apparently opposing thoughts coexist in her heart, the soul that weeps for Beatrice and the love for a new woman. This doctrine cannot be framed according to schemes or divided into items, but is rather a dialogue with invisible celestial creatures, which operate in a geometry of circles, from bottom to top, which are the radiation of God.  For the arguments and the elevated linguistic style, this book can rightly be considered an anticipation and preparation for the perfect form of <a href="#comedy">Comedy</a>.</p>

<p>Dante in the <a href="#convivioBookOne">first book</a> of the work, which has an introductory function, reasons on the ultimate happiness of man starting from Aristotelian positions. Having collected even only the crumbs of the angels' bread (wisdom, knowledge), the poet fled from ignorance; seeing other men in his former condition, he feels mercy, which is the source of good. He then institutes a banquet, to which, due to defects, inside and outside of man, few are invited. The knowledge that he administers is therefore the comment (the bread) to his songs (the courses). First, however, Dante must cleanse his bread of two stains: talking about himself (granted by danger and infamy) and his difficulty (because his works were considered of lesser value due to exile).  Finally, Dante thinks about the subject of the comment, that is the language, the vulgar preferred to Latin, which will be a new sun, light for many who are in darkness.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#convivioBookTwo">second book</a>, immediately before the First Song (Prima Canzone), the dish, the main dish, part of the food metaphor that holds the book. The poet sings the love of a new woman and how this new thinking allowed him to overcome the sadness of the death of first love, Beatrice. The comment of the poet, the bread, it aims to explain in great detail every verse of the song, then it is first necessary to instruct how to read a poetic text. He says who are the creatures to which he invites to listen to his song, the link between heaven and earth, here begin the praises of Dante to God.<br />
	On this framework, Dante builds a small medieval encyclopedia on knowledge, that is one of the purposes of the Convivio. To each heaven corresponds a science, classically divided into Trivium (Grammar, Rhetoric, Dialectic) and Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Music), and higher Physics and Moral, up to Philosophy and Theology. Eventually it will be apparent that the woman with whom Dante was in love, was not a real woman but she is the Philosophy; to this science he was introduced by the readings of Boethius, in which had sought and found consolation at the death of Beatrice, and Cicero.</p>

<p>Resuming the Convivio was a demanding experience, which gratified me. It was born from the idea of telling my personal story, a long marginalization and pain resulting from a fall. I soon realized my inability to make a narrative effective, interesting, true. So why not delve into the book first that in my distant past I remember had explained to me how more senses must be sought in a text. In 2014 and 2015, I spent months on my new reading of the Convivio and on paraphrasing. After the First Book, the first part that serves as a preface, in the Second Book I concentrated my work on the first and fourth stanza of the First Song. I would like to be one of those that <a href="#convivioBookOne#bookI_ChapterXIII_12">bread of barley</a> will satiate thousands.</p>

<p>The paraphrase was the way to fully understand the literal meaning, the outside that allows you to get inside, the true meaning, otherwise impenetrable. It has the task of transforming a text that has a linguistic register away to one current and understandable by the rules of grammar and words of the current language, maintaining, where possible, recognizability and assonance. In this case, paraphrasing means the transformation of Dante's high poetic style to a more humble one.<br />
	My paraphrase follows every division of the original text of the chapter, without references to notes. When the paraphrased text is not easily understood or of hidden meaning, in parentheses, it deserves a little explanation: or the source, when the poet quotes passages from the Gospel or other. Only when even that wasn't enough, is there an explanation on the next line.</p>

<p>For the English language, the copied Convivio is the excellent translation by Richard Lansing, who managed to combine fidelity to the text and assonance. His translation is already a paraphrase, an American who helped me a lot also to understand the text which is in vernacular Italian! Sometimes it was also useful Poetry in Translation, which is a paraphrase with a simpler language.</p>
