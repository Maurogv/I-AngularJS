<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convivio">Convivio</a> is a banquet where food is knowledge, written in the vernacular by Dante Alighieri approximately between 1304 and 1307; it consists of four treatises, the first of an unfinished work. Dante establishes this table after which he could not fail to tell the extraordinary feeling that has matured in him, which he expressed in songs. To be appreciated not only for beauty, songs require a comment because their true meaning is hidden. By revealing who is the woman who has risen above the love for Beatrice, the poet dispenses a vision of knowledge as a whole. Dante imagines nine skies that revolve around the Empire, which is still because there is God. The skies are moved by creatures without matter, who contemplate the Trinity in different ways. Every heaven is a science, the ninth heaven corresponds to Philosophy, Theology is the supreme. Down here science is being transmitted by the rays of light from the planets. The woman Dante is in love with, revealed by the Intelligences of the third heaven, to whom the poet turned because the rays of love come from their star, Venus, is not a real woman but she is Philosophy. By love he means study. The elevated linguistic style and having conceived a unitary and geometric system of knowledge, which is God one and triune contemplated, the ultimate perfection and happiness of man, will serve the poet, and make him aware, to build an even more powerful plant, which allows the journey of the <a href="#comedy">Comedy</a>.</p>

<p>Dante in the <a href="#convivioBookOne">first book</a> of the work, which has an introductory function, reasons on the ultimate happiness of man starting from Aristotelian positions. Having collected even only the crumbs of the angels' bread (wisdom, knowledge), the poet fled from ignorance; seeing other men in his former condition, he feels mercy, which is the source of good. He then institutes a banquet, to which, due to defects, inside and outside of man, few are invited. The knowledge that he administers is therefore the comment (the bread) to his songs (the courses). First, however, Dante must cleanse his bread of two stains: talking about himself (granted by danger and infamy) and his difficulty (necessary because his works were considered of lesser value due to exile). Finally, Dante thinks about the subject of the comment, that is the language, the vulgar preferred to Latin, which will be a new sun, light for many who are in darkness.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#convivioBookTwo">second book</a>, that is, after the introduction, the text of the First Song, the first of the dishes, in the food metaphor that supports the book. The poet turns to intellects that move the third heaven, as the novelty of his heart (the secret part) that he cannot hold back comes from the rays of the star of their sky, Venus. The poet asks who this gentle spirit is that contrasts the soul that still mourns the death of Beatrice. The soul is not dead, but confused; in fact, it is the thought for a woman, full of pity and humble, wise and courteous! The poet's comment first instructs on how to read a text, and as in the poets the literal sense is false while the allegory is true. It must say who and how many there are these Intelligences (or Angels) and their sky, and then the bread illuminates first on the celestial geometry. The skies are ten, of which the first, the Empyrean where there is God and blessed spirits, is still. The other nine are mobile and divided into three hierarchies. The intellects contemplate the Trinity, each according to the person and the relationship between two people. First hierarchy: Angels, Archangels, Thrones; second hierarchy: Dominations, Virtuti, Principalities; third hierarchy: Potestates, Cherubim, Seraphim. The third heaven contemplates the Holy Spirit, in the person himself. The first seven heavens is where the planets (or stars) of Ptolemaic astronomy are, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the eighth is that of the Stars, the ninth is the Crystalline or Prime Mobile. The proof of the existence of intellects without a body comes from Jesus Christ, whose birth is announced by the Archangel Gabriel, and from Jesus himself who speaks of legions of angels.<br />
	By simile, the heavens are the sciences, divided into Trivium (Grammar, Dialectic, Rhetoric) and Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Music, Geometry, Astrology), the eighth is Physics and Metaphysics, the ninth is Philosophy, or moral science, the tenth is Theology, which it is full of peace, due to the excellent certainty of its subject, which is God. In the end it will be evident that the woman Dante fell in love with, due to the rays coming from Venus, is not a real woman but is Philosophy. Finding no consolation in any way after Beatrice's death, he decided to resort to the method with which some inconsolable had found comfort, namely by reading Boethius (De consolatione philosophiae, The consolation of philosophy) and Cicero. It was the beginning of this love, which must always be understood as study, which is the application of the soul to that thing one is in love with.</p>

<p>Resuming the Convivio was a challenging and rewarding experience. It was born from the idea of telling my personal story, a long marginalization and pain resulting from a fall. I soon realized my inability to make a narrative effective, interesting, true. So why not delve into the book first that in my distant past I remember had explained to me how more senses must be sought in a text. In 2014 and 2015, I spent months on my new reading of the Convivio and on paraphrasing. After the First Book, the first part that serves as a preface, in the Second Book I concentrated my work on the first and fourth stanza of the First Song. I would like to be one of those that <a href="#convivioBookOne#bookI_ChapterXIII_12">bread of barley</a> will satiate thousands.</p>

<p>The paraphrase was the way to fully understand the literal meaning, the outside that allows you to get inside, the true meaning, otherwise impenetrable. It has the task of transforming a text that has a linguistic register away to one current and understandable by the rules of grammar and words of the current language, maintaining, where possible, recognizability and assonance. In this case, paraphrasing means the transformation of Dante's high poetic style to a more humble one.<br />
	My paraphrase follows every division of the original text of the chapter, without references to notes. When the paraphrased text is not easily understood or of hidden meaning, in parentheses, it deserves a little explanation: or the source, when the poet quotes passages from the Gospel or other. Only when even that wasn't enough, is there an explanation on the next line.</p>

<p>For the English language, the copied Convivio is the excellent translation by Richard Lansing, who managed to combine fidelity to the text and assonance. His translation is already a paraphrase, an American who helped me a lot also to understand the text which is in vernacular Italian! Sometimes it was also useful Poetry in Translation, which is a paraphrase with a simpler language.</p>
