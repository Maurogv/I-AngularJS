I-AngularJS
================

The platform for I is [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), the powerful and innovative MVW Javascript framework for writing applications by Google getting a Single Page Application. AngularJS lets extend HTMLâ€™s syntax, automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding and teaches the browser how to do [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [inversion of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).  
MVW (Model-View-Whatever) is an evolution of the programming model [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-View-Controller). Over time and thanks to many [refactorings]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) and [api](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) improvements, AngularJS is now closer to [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel), the $scope object could be considered the ViewModel that is being decorated by a function (Controller). This framework flexibility has been named as whatever (W), whatever works for you.  
The language of the style sheets, the [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) that gives the appearance and formatting of the page, is [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).  
The code in the client, Javascript, builds the table of contents, references to the notes of each page and back to top, list domains of hyperlinks and photos, add an icon at the end of the hyperlink when the domain is present in a json library, associating domain to icon of dimension 16x16.  
The photos were posted on various sites that make up the repository, such as flickr, google +, wikimedia.

Github as well as being an open source community of code-sharing, can perform the static html pages. with css and javascript there is not client-server computing. Because AngularJS Google's technology is entirely client can make pages on Github with the only code available, showing that the adjective superheroic coined by the developers of the platform is valid.

The sharing of the code on Github and the possibility to access to make them on its platform is an important step for a future publication of a standalone site.
