This project was born from the desire to tell my story after an unfortunate event, a crash occurred when I was 18 years old, showing  attempts to understand the causes and consequences of physical pain that progressively worsens, the choices in the belief that can alleviate their if not eliminate, the impact on daily life and family. I will focus on the one hand the value of institutions and medical personnel, the capsizing, transformation and distortion of reality,  the ignorance, the environment, city and  region, will emerge, on the other hand, my strength, determination, the power of hope, reasoning that does adhere to objective things, intelligence, wait, experience and needs help. In the progression of the story will also clarify the economic and the fiction of its assessment. It's a site that contains a complaint and a modern work to read.

Main section explains the medical consultations, medical examinations with their documentation when possible, the decisions taken and, more generally, the relationship between human, patient, physician, and system structure. One part is dedicated to my personal and professional construction with reference to my maestroes while other pages dealing with topics lighter and liking, places I've visited, my passions such as sport, mountain, the hobby of collecting paper that becomes an attempt to earn some money. Some pages, or a part of its, are functional to a broader illustration of the story.  
Last but not least, the writing and management of the site allows me to exercise and maintain my passion for computers and their programming, passion born when I was teen.

The platform used is [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), the powerful and innovative MVW Javascript framework for writing applications by Google getting a Single Page Application. AngularJS lets extend HTMLâ€™s syntax, automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding and teaches the browser how to do [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [inversion of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control). 

The programming model is that MVC made even more powerful (C that becomes W, Whatever) with the addition to the controller of components and services written as a client.

The front-end of the style is the [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), while JavaScript code builds the index and references to the notes of each page; hyperlinks also have an icon when the domain is present in data json file that associates the domain to icon. The pages are text and photographs, and the connection to the data source is confined to a few pages. The photos were posted on various sites that make up the repository, such as flickr, google +, wikimedia, ...

Github as well as being an open source community of code-sharing, can perform the static html pages with css and javascript, there is no client-server computing. Because Angular JS Google's technology is entirely client can make pages on Github with the only code available, showing that the adjective superheroic coined by the developers of the platform is valid.

The sharing of the code on Github and the possibility to access to make them on its platform is an important step for a future publication of a standalone site.
