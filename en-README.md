I-AngularJS
================

I built I, a website that was supposed to tell about me, through the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) platform. The powerful and innovative MVW Javascript framework for writing applications by Google getting a Single Page Application, similar to one desktop.  
AngularJS lets extend HTMLâ€™s syntax, automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding and teaches the browser how to do [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [inversion of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).  
MVW (Model-View-Whatever) is an evolution of the programming model [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-View-Controller). Over time and thanks to many [refactorings]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) and [api](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) improvements, AngularJS is now closer to [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel), the $scope object could be considered the ViewModel that is being decorated by a function (Controller). This framework flexibility has been named as whatever (W), whatever works for you.  

My interface, the front-end, uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), the framework for a web application, that contains HTML and [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.  
As I wanted additional features, with **Javascript** I built the index, the notes, the list of domain names of each external link, a list is for photos only. The code also creates a hypertextual progressive number that goes to the citation of the source, contained in the notes, and from the quotation goes back.  
The photos of I are on the Internet in some popular image hosting service, flickr, google+, wikimedia.

Github, the open source community to share the code, allows to perform the static html pages. Since Google's technology is entirely client, Github renders them, proving that the superhero adjective for AngularJS is truthful.  
This sharing is an important step for the development of my site.
