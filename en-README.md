I-AngularJS
================

The site was born from the desire and need to tell my story after a fall illustrating the numerous attempts to understand the origin of pain, the care, the trend of health conditions, the relationship with physicians and institutions, the vicissitudes. Provides elements of my training and my human passions that may be of understanding the whole story, while a section describing places known to me.



I apologize for having to tell about me, accepting my fate, led in the wrong direction, the writing can bring clarity and justice in the search for truth and salvation, be bread for others.  
Helped by maestoes and celestial forces, not ignorant of God's mercy, the site can show the course of the story in a manner consistent with the sequence of events and understandable by providing the information, aided by documents, comments, analysis and explanations.  
Highlighting the inability of doctors and facilities to understand the origin of the pain, superficial diagnosis, the upsetting, deformation, and overturning of situation away from the search for truth, their repetition. The consequences are unnecessary care when is not wrong, worsening health condition due to lack or false objective, in the refusal of responsibility and guilt, disregard of responsibility and guilt and other thing, economic conditions evaluated hypocritically. The story takes place in Milan and Lombardy with economic dependence of the sick charged to the family.  

The language show my lack of faculty, where there was, in the inscrutable judgment that my story can be known, in part or whole.

The platform used is [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), the powerful and innovative MVW Javascript framework for writing applications by Google getting a Single Page Application. AngularJS lets extend HTML’s syntax, automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding and teaches the browser how to do [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [inversion of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).  
The programming model is that MVC made even more powerful (C that becomes W, Whatever) with the addition to the controller of components and services written as a client.  
The page style is [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). The code in the client, Javascript, builds the index and references to the notes of each page, list domains of hyperlinks and photos, add an icon at the end of the hyperlink when the domain is present in a json library, associating domain to icon of dimension 16x16.  
The photos were posted on various sites that make up the repository, such as flickr, google +, wikimedia, ...

Github as well as being an open source community of code-sharing, can perform the static html pages with css and javascript, there is no client-server computing. Because AngularJS Google's technology is entirely client can make pages on Github with the only code available, showing that the adjective superheroic coined by the developers of the platform is valid.

The sharing of the code on Github and the possibility to access to make them on its platform is an important step for a future publication of a standalone site.
