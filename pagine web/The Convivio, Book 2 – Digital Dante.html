<p align="JUSTIFY"><b><i><a name="01"></a>Chapter 1</i></b></p>
<p>Now that by way of a preface my bread has been sufficiently prepared 
in the preceding book through my own assistance, time calls and requires
 my ship to leave port; thus, having set the sail of my reason to the 
breeze of my desire, I enter upon the open sea with the hope of a smooth
 voyage and a safe and praiseworthy port at the end of my feast. But so 
that this food of mine may be more profitable, I wish to show, before it
 appears, how the first course must be eaten.</p>
<p>As I stated in the first chapter, this exposition must be both 
literal and allegorical. To convey what this means, it is necessary to 
know that writings can be understood and ought to be expounded 
principally in four senses. The first is called the literal, and this is
 the sense that does not go beyond the surface of the letter, as in the 
fables of the poets. The next is called the allegorical, and this is the
 one that is hidden beneath the cloak of these fables, and is a truth 
hidden beneath a beautiful fiction. Thus Ovid says that with his lyre 
Orpheus tamed wild beasts and made trees and rocks move toward him, 
which is to say that the wise man with the instrument of his voice makes
 cruel hearts grow tender and humble and moves to his will those who do 
not devote their lives to knowledge and art; and those who have no 
rational life whatsoever are almost like stones. Why this kind of 
concealment was devised by the wise will be shown in the penultimate 
book. Indeed the theologians take this sense otherwise than do the 
poets; but since it is my intention here to follow the method of the 
poets, I shall take the allegorical sense according to the usage of the 
poets.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup></p>
<p>The third sense is called moral, and this is the sense that teachers 
should intently seek to discover throughout the scriptures, for their 
own profit and that of their pupils; as, for example, in the Gospel we 
may discover that when Christ ascended the mountain to be transfigured, 
of the twelve Apostles he took with him but three, the moral meaning of 
which is that in matters of great secrecy we should have few companions.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p>The fourth sense is called anagogical, that is to say, beyond the 
senses; and this occurs when a scripture is expounded in a spiritual 
sense which, although it is true also in the literal sense, signifies by
 means of the things signified a part of the supernal things of eternal 
glory, as may be seen in the song of the Prophet which says that when 
the people of Israel went out of Egypt, Judea was made whole and free.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>&nbsp;For
 although it is manifestly true according to the letter, that which is 
spiritually intended is no less true, namely, that when the soul departs
 from sin it is made whole and free in its power. In this kind of 
explication, the literal should always come first, as being the sense in
 whose meaning the others are enclosed, and without which it would be 
impossible and illogical to attend to the other senses, and especially 
the allegorical. It would be impossible because in everything that has 
an inside and an outside it is impossible to arrive at the inside 
without first arriving at the outside; consequently, since in what is 
written down the literal meaning is always the outside, it is impossible
 to arrive at the other senses, especially the allegorical, without 
first arriving at the literal.</p>
<p>Moreover, it would be impossible because in every natural or 
artificial thing it is impossible to proceed to the form unless the 
subject on which the form must be imposed is prepared first–just as it 
is impossible for a piece of jewelry to acquire its form if the material
 (that is, its subject) is not first arranged and prepared, or a chest 
to acquire its form if the material (that is, the wood) is not first 
arranged and prepared. Consequently, since the literal meaning is always
 the subject and material of the other senses, especially of the 
allegorical, it is impossible to come to an understanding of them before
 coming to an understanding of it. Moreover, it would be impossible 
because in every natural or artificial thing it is impossible to proceed
 unless the foundation is laid first, as in a house or in studying; 
consequently, since explication is the building up of knowledge, and the
 explication of the literal sense is the foundation of the others, 
especially of the allegorical, it is impossible to arrive at the other 
senses without first arriving at it.</p>
<p>Moreover, even supposing it were possible, it would be illogical, 
that is to say out of order, and would therefore be carried out with 
great labor and much confusion. Consequently as the Philosopher says in 
the first book of the&nbsp;<i>Physics</i>, nature wills that we proceed 
in due order in our learning, that is, by proceeding from that which we 
know better to that which we know not so well; I say that nature wills 
it since this way of learning is by nature innate in us.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup>&nbsp;Therefore
 if the senses other than the literal are less understood (which they 
are, as is quite apparent), it would be illogical to proceed to explain 
them if the literal had not been explicated first. For these reasons, 
therefore, I shall on each occasion discuss first the literal meaning 
concerning each canzone, and afterwards I shall discuss its allegory 
(that is, the hidden truth), at times touching on the other senses, when
 opportune, as time and place deem proper.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="02"></a>Chapter 2</i></b></p>
<p>To begin, then, I say that after the passing of that blessed Beatrice
 who lives in heaven with the angels and on earth with my soul, the star
 of Venus had twice revolved in that circle of hers, which at different 
times of the year makes her appear in the evening or in the morning,<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>&nbsp;when that gentle lady, of whom I made mention at the end of the&nbsp;<i>New Life</i>, first appeared before my eyes, accompanied by Love, and took a place within my mind.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup></p>
<p>As I have recounted in the above-mentioned little book, it came to 
pass that I consented to be hers more because of her gentleness than 
through choice of my own; for she showed herself to be impassioned by so
 great a pity for my widowed life that the spirits of my eyes became 
most friendly toward her. And having accomplished this, they then so 
fashioned her within me that my pleasure was content to wed itself to 
that image. But because love is not born and does not grow and reach 
perfection in a moment but requires time and nourishment of thought, 
especially where there are opposing thoughts that impede it, it was 
necessary before this new love could become perfect that there be much 
strife between the thought that nourished it and the one that opposed 
it, which still held the citadel of my mind on behalf of that glorious 
Beatrice.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup>&nbsp;For the one was 
continually reinforced by the part of the memory in front, and the other
 by the part of the memory in back; and the support in front, being that
 which hindered me from turning my gaze in any way backward, increased 
with each day, which the other could not do; hence it seemed to me so 
wonderful and also so hard to endure that I could not bear it. And 
almost crying out aloud, to excuse myself for the change in which I 
seemed to show a lack of strength, I directed my voice to that quarter 
from which the victory of the new thought emerged, which was most 
powerful, like celestial virtue; and I began by saying&nbsp;<i>You whose intellect the third sphere moves</i>.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>To apprehend the meaning of this canzone properly it is first 
necessary to know its parts, so that afterwards it will be easy to 
perceive its meaning. And so that there should be no need of placing 
these words in front of the expositions of the other canzoni, I say that
 the order which will be adopted in this book I intend to maintain also 
for the others.</p>
<p>I say then that the canzone before us is composed of three principal 
parts. The first is the first stanza of the canzone: here certain 
Intelligences, or Angels, as we are more accustomed to call them, which 
preside over the revolution of the heaven of Venus as its movers, are 
invited to listen to what I intend to say. The second comprises the 
three stanzas which follow the first: here is shown what was heard 
within, spiritually, between the different thoughts. The third is the 
fifth and last stanza: here one generally addresses the work itself, as 
if to encourage it. All three of these parts, as has been indicated 
above, will be explicated in order.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="03"></a>Chapter 3</i></b></p>
<p>In order to discern more clearly the literal sense of the first part 
according to the division made above (which is our present concern), we 
must know who and how many they are who are summoned to hear me, and 
what this third heaven is which I say they move; first I will speak of 
the heaven, and then I will speak of those whom I address. Although 
these things can be but little known with respect to their true reality,
 that portion of them that human reason sees brings more delight than 
the plenitude and the certainty of the things which we judge more fully,
 according to the opinion of the Philosopher in his book&nbsp;<i>On Animals</i>.</p>
<p>I say then that concerning the number and the position of the heavens
 many different opinions are held, although the truth has at last been 
discovered. Aristotle, merely following the longstanding ignorance of 
the astrologers, believed that there were only eight heavens, of which 
the outermost, containing the whole, was the one on which the stars are 
fixed, namely, the eighth sphere, and that beyond it there was no other.
 Moreover, he believed that the heaven of the Sun was contiguous to that
 of the Moon, that is to say, was second from us. Anyone who wishes can 
find this extremely erroneous opinion of his in the second book of 
his&nbsp;<i>Heaven and the World</i>, which is in the second of the books about Nature. However, he excuses himself for this in the twelfth book of the&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics</i>, where he plainly shows that he was only following the opinion of others where he was obliged to speak of astrology.</p>
<p>Later Ptolemy, perceiving that the eighth sphere moved with several 
movements (since he saw that its circle deviated from the true circle 
which turns everything from east to west) and constrained by the 
principles of philosophy, which necessitated the simplest&nbsp;<i>primum mobile</i>,
 supposed that another heaven existed beyond that of the Fixed Stars 
which made this revolution from east to west, a revolution that, I say, 
is completed in about twenty-four hours (that is, in twenty-three hours 
and fourteen out of fifteen parts of another, roughly speaking).<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup></p>
<p>So that according to him and according to the received opinion in 
astrology and in philosophy since the time those movements were first 
perceived, there are nine moving heavens; and their position is manifest
 and determined by the art called optics, and by arithmetic and 
geometry, as is perceived by the senses and by reason, and by other 
demonstrations to the senses. Thus during an eclipse of the Sun it 
appears to our senses that the Moon lies below the Sun, and this is also
 the testimony of Aristotle who with his own eyes (as he tells us in the
 second book of&nbsp;<i>Heaven and the World</i>) saw the Moon, 
half-full, pass below Mars with her dark side forward, and Mars remain 
hidden till it reappeared from the other, bright side of the Moon, which
 was facing west.</p>
<p>The order of their position is as follows.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>&nbsp;The
 first in number is the one in which the Moon resides; the second is the
 one in which Mercury resides; the third is the one in which Venus 
resides; the fourth is the one in which the Sun resides; the fifth is 
that of Mars; the sixth is that of Jupiter; the seventh is that of 
Saturn; the eighth is that of the Stars; the ninth is the one which is 
not perceptible to the senses except for the movement mentioned above, 
and which many call the Crystalline (that is to say, the diaphanous or 
completely transparent) Heaven. Moreover, outside all of these the 
Catholics place the Empyrean Heaven, which is to say, the “heaven of 
flame,” or “luminous heaven”; and they hold it to be motionless because 
it has in itself, with respect to each of its parts, that which its 
matter desires. This is the reason why the Primum Mobile has the 
swiftest movement; for because of the most fervent desire that each part
 of the ninth heaven has to be conjoined with every part of that 
divinest, tranquil heaven, to which it is contiguous, it revolves 
beneath it with such desire that its velocity is almost 
incomprehensible. Stillness and peace are the qualities of the place of 
that Supreme Deity which alone completely beholds itself. This is the 
place of the blessed spirits, according to the will of the Holy Church, 
which cannot lie. Aristotle, to anyone who rightly understands him, 
seems to hold the same opinion in the first book of&nbsp;<i>Heaven and the World</i>.
 This is the supreme edifice of the universe in which all the world is 
enclosed and beyond which there is nothing; it is not itself in space 
but was formed solely in the Primal Mind, which the Greeks call 
Protonoe.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup>&nbsp;This is that 
magnificence of which the Psalmist spoke when he says to God: “Your 
magnificence is exalted above the heavens.”<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup>&nbsp;So
 to sum up what has been said, it is apparent that there are ten 
heavens, of which the heaven of Venus is the third, mention of which is 
made in that part of the canzone which I now intend to explicate.</p>
<p>We should know that each heaven beneath the Crystalline has two 
stationary poles, stationary with respect to itself; and in the ninth 
they are stationary and fixed, and immutable in every respect. Each one,
 the ninth as well as the rest, has a circle which may be called the 
equator of its own heaven, which in every part of its revolution is 
equally distant from both poles, as anyone can see from experience by 
spinning an apple or any other round object. In every heaven this circle
 has greater swiftness of movement than any other part of its heaven, as
 anyone can see upon careful consideration. And each part moves faster 
the nearer it is to the equator, and slower the farther away it is from 
it and closer to the pole, because its revolution is smaller and must of
 necessity be completed in the same period of time as the greater. I 
say, moreover, that the nearer a heaven is to the equatorial circle, the
 more noble it is in comparison to its poles, because it has more 
movement and more actuality and more life and more form, and it 
approaches more closely the heaven which is above it, and consequently 
has more virtue. Therefore the stars of the Starry Heaven are more full 
of virtue, compared with each other, the nearer they are to this circle.</p>
<p>On the outer edge of this circle, in the heaven of Venus, which we 
are treating at present, there is a small sphere which revolves by 
itself in that heaven, whose circle the astrologers call an epicycle.<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup>&nbsp;And
 just as the great sphere revolves on two poles, so does this small one;
 and so does this small one have its equatorial circle, and so is it 
nobler the nearer it is to this; and upon the arc or outer edge of this 
circle is fixed that most brilliant star of Venus. Although we have said
 that according to strict truth there are ten heavens, this number does 
not comprise them all; for the one just mentioned, namely, the epicycle 
on which the star is fixed, is a heaven or sphere in and of itself, and 
is not of one essence with that which carries it, although it shares its
 nature more with it than with the others, and is spoken of as one 
heaven with it, and both are named after the star. How it is with the 
other heavens and the other stars is not to be dealt with at present; 
let suffice what has been said of the truth of the third heaven, with 
which I am at present concerned and about which all that is necessary 
for the present has been fully explained.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="04"></a>Chapter 4</i></b></p>
<p>Now that in the preceding chapter it has been shown what this third 
heaven is and how it is ordered in itself, it remains to show who they 
are who move it. And so we must first know that its movers are 
substances separate from matter, namely Intelligences, which the common 
people call Angels. Although the truth is now known, different people 
have held different opinions about these creatures as they have about 
the heavens. There were certain philosophers, among whom seems to be 
Aristotle in his&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics</i>&nbsp;(although in the first book on&nbsp;<i>Heaven</i>&nbsp;he
 appears incidentally to think otherwise), who believed that there were 
only as many of these beings as there were circular movements in the 
heavens, and no more, saying that any others would have existed in vain 
for eternity and have lacked all activity, which would be impossible 
since their being consists of their activity. There were others, like 
Plato, a most eminent man, who maintained that there are not only as 
many Intelligences as there are movements in heaven but also as many as 
there are species of things, just as there is one species for all men, 
another for all gold, another for all dimensions, and so on. They held 
that just as the Intelligences of the heavens brought them into being, 
each its own, so other Intelligences brought into being all other things
 and exemplars, each its own species; and Plato called them “ideas,” 
which is as much as to say universal forms and natures.</p>
<p>The pagans call them Gods and Goddesses, although they did not think 
of them in a philosophical sense as did Plato, and they venerated images
 of them and built great temples to them, as, for example, to Juno whom 
they called goddess of power, to Pallas or Minerva whom they called 
goddess of wisdom, to Vulcan whom they called god of fire, or to Ceres 
whom they called goddess of grain. These matters and opinions are made 
evident by the testimony of the poets, who depict in various places the 
custom of the pagans both in their sacrifices and in their creed, and 
they are also manifest in the many ancient names which survive as names 
or surnames of places and of ancient buildings, as anyone who wishes can
 easily discover.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned opinions were the product of human 
reason and no scant observation, they nevertheless did not perceive the 
truth because of both a deficiency of reason and a lack of instruction; 
for even by reason alone it can be perceived that the creatures 
mentioned above are of far greater number than are the effects which men
 can apprehend. One reason is this: no one, whether philosopher, pagan, 
Jew, Christian, or member of any sect, doubts that they are full of all 
blessedness, either all or the greater part of them, or that these 
blessed ones are in the most perfect state of being. Consequently, since
 human nature as it exists here has not only one blessedness but two, 
namely that of the civil life and that of the contemplative life, it 
would be illogical for us to find that these beings have the blessedness
 of the active (that is, of the civil) life, in governing the world, and
 not that of the contemplative life, which is more excellent and more 
divine. And since the one that has the blessedness of governing cannot 
have the other because their intellect is one and perpetual, there must 
be others outside this ministry who live by contemplation alone. Because
 this life is more divine, and the more divine a thing is the more it is
 like God, it is manifest that this life is more loved by God; and if it
 is more loved, the more has its blessedness been bountiful; and if it 
has been more bountiful, the more living beings has he given to it than 
to the other. We conclude from this that the number of these creatures 
is much greater than the effects reveal.</p>
<p>This does not run counter to what Aristotle seems to say in the tenth book of the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>, namely that the contemplative life alone befits separate substances.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>&nbsp;Although
 the contemplative life alone befits them, to the contemplative life of 
just a certain number of them falls the circular movement of the heaven,
 which is the governing of the world, which is a kind of civil order 
conceived within the contemplation of its movers.</p>
<p>The other reason is that no effect is greater than its cause, because
 the cause cannot give what it does not have; consequently, since the 
divine intellect is the cause of everything, above all of the human 
intellect, it obtains that the human intellect does not transcend the 
divine, but is out of all proportion transcended by it. Therefore if for
 the above reasons and for many others we understand that God could have
 created almost innumerable spiritual creatures, it is manifest that he 
has made this greater number of them. Many other reasons can be adduced,
 but let these suffice for the present.</p>
<p>No one should be surprised if these and other reasons which we might 
have concerning this matter are not fully demonstrated; but nevertheless
 we should admire the excellence of these creatures–which transcends the
 eyes of the human mind, as the Philosopher says in the second book of 
the&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics</i>–and affirm their existence. For although we 
cannot perceive them with the senses (from which our knowledge 
originates), yet there shines in our intellect some light of their most 
lively existence insofar as we perceive the above-mentioned reasons and 
many others–just as one whose eyes are closed may affirm that the air is
 luminous because some slight radiance or ray of light, such as passes 
through the pupils of a bat, reaches him. For in just this way the eyes 
of our intellect are closed, as long as the soul is bound and imprisoned
 by the organs of our body.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="05"></a>Chapter 5</i></b></p>
<p>It has been said that because of a lack of instruction the ancients 
did not perceive the truth concerning spiritual creatures, even though 
the people of Israel were in part taught by their prophets, “through 
whom, by many manners of speech and in many ways, God had spoken to 
them,” as the Apostle says.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>&nbsp;But
 we have been taught about this by him who came from him, by him who 
made them, by him who preserves them, that is by the Emperor of the 
Universe, who is Christ, son of the sovereign God and son of the Virgin 
Mary, the true woman and daughter of Joachim and of Adam, the true man 
who was slain by us, by which he brought us to life. “He was the light 
that shines for us in the darkness,” as John the Evangelist says; and he
 told us the truth concerning those things which without him we could 
not know nor truly perceive.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup></p>
<p>The first thing and the first secret that he showed us was one of the
 above-mentioned creatures, and this was his great ambassador who came 
to Mary, a young maiden thirteen years of age, on behalf of the heavenly
 Healer. Our Saviour said with his own lips that the Father was able to 
give him many legions of angels; when he was told that the Father had 
ordered the Angels to minister unto and serve him, he did not deny it 
was true. Consequently it is evident to us that those creatures exist in
 extraordinary numbers, for his spouse and secretary the Holy Church–of 
whom Solomon says “Who is this that comes from the desert, laden with 
those things that give delight, leaning upon her friend?”–affirms, 
believes, and preaches that these most noble creatures are all but 
innumerable.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>&nbsp;And she divides 
them into three hierarchies, which is to say three holy or divine 
principalities, each hierarchy having three orders, so that the Church 
holds and affirms that there are nine orders of spiritual creatures.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup>The
 first is that of the Angels, the second of the Archangels, the third of
 the Thrones; and these three orders make up the first hierarchy: not 
first in order of nobility, nor of creation (for the others are nobler 
and all were created at one time), but first in the order of our ascent 
to their degree of elevation. Then come the Dominations, next the 
Virtues, then the Principalities, and these make up the second 
hierarchy. Above these are the Powers and the Cherubim, and above all 
are the Seraphim, and these make up the third hierarchy.</p>
<p>The principal motive of their contemplation lies in the numerical 
position in which the hierarchies and in which the orders reside. For, 
since the Divine Majesty exists in three persons who have one substance,
 it is possible to contemplate them in a threefold manner. For it is 
possible to contemplate the supreme power of the Father, upon which the 
first hierarchy gazes, that is, the one which is first in nobility and 
which we count as last. It is also possible to contemplate the supreme 
wisdom of the Son; this the second hierarchy gazes upon. And it is 
possible to contemplate the supreme and most fervent love of the Holy 
Spirit; this the last hierarchy gazes upon, which being nearest to us 
bestows upon us the gifts which it receives. Since each person of the 
divine Trinity can be considered in a threefold manner, there are in 
each hierarchy three orders that contemplate in different ways. It is 
possible to consider the Father with regard to but him alone, and this 
contemplation the Seraphim perform, who perceive more of the First Cause
 than any other angelic nature. It is possible to consider the Father 
with respect to the relation he has to the Son, that is, how he is 
separated from him and how united with him; and this the Cherubim 
contemplate. It is further possible to consider the Father with respect 
to how the Holy Spirit proceeds from him, and how it is separated from 
him and how united with him; and this contemplation the Powers perform. 
In this same way it is possible to contemplate the Son and the Holy 
Spirit: consequently it is appropriate that there should be nine classes
 of contemplative spirits, to gaze upon the light which can only be 
completely beheld by itself.</p>
<p>Here one word must not be left unsaid. I say that of all these orders
 a certain number were lost as soon as they were created, perhaps 
one-tenth in number, for the restoration of which part human nature was 
afterwards created.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup>&nbsp;The moving 
heavens, which are nine, declare the numbers, the orders, and the 
hierarchies, and the tenth proclaims the very unity and stability of 
God. Therefore the Psalmist says: “The heavens declare the glory of God,
 and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.”<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup>&nbsp;Consequently
 it is reasonable to believe that the movers of the heaven of the Moon 
belong to the order of the Angels, and those of Mercury to that of the 
Archangels, and those of Venus to that of the Thrones; all of whom, 
receiving their nature from the love of the Holy Spirit, perform their 
operation, which is innate in them, namely, the movement of that heaven,
 filled with love, from which the form of the said heaven derives a 
potent ardor by which the souls here below are kindled to love, 
according to their disposition. Because the ancients recognized that 
this heaven was the cause of love here below, they said that Love was 
the son of Venus, as Vergil attests to in the first book of the&nbsp;<i>Aeneid</i>, where Venus says to Love: “My son, my power, son of the supreme father, who heeds not the darts of Typhoeus”;<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup>&nbsp;and Ovid, in the fifth book of the&nbsp;<i>Metamorphoses</i>, when he says that Venus said to Love: “My son, my arms, my power.”<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup></p>
<p>These Thrones, who are assigned to govern this heaven, are not great 
in number, though the philosophers and the astrologers have estimated it
 diversely according to how diversely they have estimated its rotations,
 although all are agreed on this point: that there are as many of them 
as there are movements made by the heaven. According to the best 
demonstration of the astrologers as we find it summarized in the book of
 the&nbsp;<i>Constellations of the Stars</i>, these movements are three:
 one according to which the star moves along its epicycle; a second 
according to which the epicycle moves together with the whole heaven in 
concert with that of the Sun; a third according to which that whole 
heaven moves, following the movement of the starry sphere, from west to 
east, one degree every one hundred years.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup>&nbsp;Thus
 for these three movements there are three movers. Moreover, the whole 
of this heaven moves and revolves with the epicycle from east to west 
once every day. Whether this movement derives from some intellect or 
from the pull of the Primum Mobile, only God knows, for it seems to me 
presumptuous to reach a conclusion on this point.</p>
<p>These movers by their intellect alone produce the revolution in that 
proper subject which each one moves. The most noble form of heaven, 
which has in itself the principle of this passive nature, revolves at 
the touch of the motive power which understands it; and by touch I mean 
contact, though not in a bodily sense, with the virtue which is directed
 toward it. These are the movers to whom my speech is addressed and 
about whom I make my inquiry.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="06"></a>Chapter 6</i></b></p>
<p>According to what was said above in the third chapter of this book, 
it was necessary, in order to understand properly the first part of the 
canzone before us, to speak of those heavens and of those who move them,
 and in the preceding three chapters this has been discussed. I say then
 to those whom I have shown to be the movers of the heaven of 
Venus:&nbsp;<i>You whose intellect</i>–that is, whose intellect alone, as has been said above–<i>the third sphere moves, Now listen to the speech</i>;
 and I do not say “listen” as though they should hear sound, for they 
have no sense perception, but I say “listen,” that is, with that hearing
 which they do have, which is understanding by the intellect.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>&nbsp;I
 say: Listen to the speech that is in my heart, that is, within me, for 
it has not yet appeared without. And we must know that throughout this 
entire canzone, according to the one sense and the other, the “heart” is
 to be taken as the secret place within and not as some special part of 
the soul or body.</p>
<p>After I have summoned them to listen to what I wish to say, I assign 
two reasons why it is fitting for me to speak to them. One is the 
strangeness of my condition, which not having been experienced by other 
men could not be so well understood by them as by those beings who 
understand their own effects in their operation; and this reason I touch
 on when I say&nbsp;<i>For I cannot speak to others, so strange it seems</i>.
 The other reason is that when a person receives a benefit or an injury,
 he must first relate it to the one who has brought it about, if he can,
 rather than to others; so that if it is a benefit, he who receives it 
shows himself grateful toward his benefactor; and if it is an injury, he
 should move the malefactor with gentle words to kind compassion. I 
touch on this reason when I say&nbsp;<i>The heaven that moves according to your power Draws me, O noble creatures that you are, into the state in which I find myself</i>–that
 is to say, your operation (that is, your revolution) is what has drawn 
me into my present condition. Consequently I conclude by stating that my
 speech must be to them, as has been said; and this I say with the 
words&nbsp;<i>And hence these words about the life I live Should properly be addressed to you</i>.</p>
<p>After assigning these reasons, I beg them to listen to me when I say&nbsp;<i>And so I pray that you will listen to me</i>.
 But because in every kind of discourse the speaker should above all be 
intent on persuading (that is, on charming) his audience to listen–for 
this is the beginning of all other persuasions, according to the 
practice of the rhetoricians–and since the most potent persuasion for 
rendering the listener attentive is to promise to tell new and momentous
 things, I arrange to have this persuasion (that is, this charm) follow 
after the petition to be heard, announcing my intention to them, which 
is to speak of new things (that is, of the division that is in my soul) 
and of momentous things (that is, of the influence of their star). And 
this I say in the last words of this first part:&nbsp;<i>I shall recount
 the strangeness in my heart, How here within my sad soul weeps And how 
against her speaks a spirit that comes Upon the rays descending from 
your star</i>.</p>
<p>To convey the full meaning of these words, I say that this spirit is 
nothing other than a frequent thought to praise and adorn this new lady;
 and this soul is nothing other than another thought accompanied by an 
act of assent, which, opposing the former, praises and adorns the memory
 of that glorious Beatrice.<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup>&nbsp;But
 since the final verdict of my mind (that is, its act of assent) was 
still held fast by this thought which my memory reinforces, I call 
it&nbsp;<i>soul&nbsp;</i>and the other&nbsp;<i>spirit</i>; just as we 
are used to calling a “city” those who hold it and not those who are 
attacking it, even though both are citizens. I say, moreover, that this 
spirit comes upon the rays of the star, because it is necessary to know 
that the rays of each heaven are the paths along which their virtue 
descends upon these things here below. Since rays are nothing other than
 the shining which comes from the source of the light through the air to
 the thing illuminated, and there is no light except from the body of 
the star, because the rest of the heaven is diaphanous (that is, 
transparent), I do not say that this spirit (that is, this thought) 
comes from their heaven as a whole but from their star. This star, by 
reason of the nobility of those who move it, is of such great virtue 
that it has immense influence upon our souls and upon all things 
belonging to us, notwithstanding that its distance from us, when it is 
nearest to us, is 167 times the distance to the center of the earth (and
 more), which is 3250 miles. This is the literal exposition of the first
 part of the canzone.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="07"></a>Chapter 7</i></b></p>
<p>The literal meaning of the first part may be sufficiently understood 
by the above words; consequently the second must now be attended to, 
which reveals what I experienced of conflict within. And this part has a
 further division, for in the first, that is, in the first stanza, I 
relate the nature of these conflicting thoughts which were within me, 
according to their root; then I relate what each of these conflicting 
thoughts said: first what the side that lost said (that is, in the 
stanza which is the second of this part and the third of the canzone) 
and then what the new thought said (that is, in the stanza which is the 
third of this part and the fourth of the canzone).</p>
<p>To make clear then the meaning of the first division, we must observe
 that things should be named according to the highest nobility of their 
form, as, for example, man from reason and not from the senses, nor 
anything else that is less noble. Therefore when we say that man lives, 
what is meant to be understood is that he uses his reason, which is his 
special life and the actualizing of his most noble part. Therefore he 
who departs from his reason and uses merely his sensitive part lives not
 as a man but as a beast; as that most excellent Boethius says, “He 
lives the life of an ass.”<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup>&nbsp;Rightly
 so, I say, because thought is an act peculiar to reason, for beasts do 
not think, since they have no reason; and I say this not only of the 
lesser beasts, but of those that have the semblance of a man and the 
spirit of a sheep or some other detestable animal.</p>
<p>I say, then, that the life of my heart (that is, of my inner self) 
used to be a sweet thought (“sweet” is the same as “suasive,” that is, 
charming, gentle, pleasing, and delightful), a thought which would often
 go to the feet of the Lord of those beings whom I address, namely God; 
this is to say that I, in thought, contemplated the kingdom of the 
blessed. And immediately I tell the final cause of my ascending there in
 thought when I say&nbsp;<i>Where it would see a lady in glorious light</i>,
 to make it understood that it is because I was certain, and still am, 
by reason of her gracious revelation, that she was in heaven. So to the 
extent of my ability I often went there in thought, as if I had been 
seized.</p>
<p>Then subsequently I tell the effect of this thought, which was so 
great that to make its sweetness understood it made me long for death, 
so as to go where it had gone, and this I say with the words&nbsp;<i>Of whom it would speak to me so sweetly That my soul would say: “I wish to go there</i>.”
 This is the root of one of the conflicting thoughts within me. It 
should also be known that what ascended to behold that blessed one is 
here called “thought” and not “soul,” because it was a thought 
especially conceived for that act. By soul is meant, as was said in the 
previous chapter, thought in general with assent.</p>
<p>Then when I say&nbsp;<i>Now one appears who puts it to flight</i>, I 
tell of the root of the other conflicting thought, saying that just as 
this thought, mentioned above, used to be my life, so another appears 
which makes that one cease to exist. I say “to flight,” to show this one
 to be contrary, for by nature one contrary flees another, and the one 
that flees shows that it flees for lack of strength. And I say that this
 new thought that appears has the power to seize me and to conquer my 
entire soul, saying that it so rules that the heart (that is, my inner 
self) trembles, and my outer self shows it by a certain new semblance.</p>
<p>Subsequently I show the power of this new thought by its effect, 
saying that it makes me gaze upon a lady and addresses words of flattery
 to me (that is, speaks before the eyes of my intellectual affection in 
order the better to draw me over, promising me that the sight of her 
eyes is its salvation). And the better to convince the experienced soul 
of this, it says that the eyes of this lady are not to be looked upon by
 anyone who fears sighs of anguish. It is a fine rhetorical figure which
 makes a thing seem outwardly lacking in beauty, while inwardly making 
it truly beautiful. The new thought of love could not better induce my 
mind to give consent than by speaking so profoundly on the virtue of 
that lady’s eyes.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="08"></a>Chapter 8</i></b></p>
<p>Now that it has been shown how and why love is born and what conflict
 embattled me, it is appropriate to disclose the meaning of that part in
 which conflicting thoughts contend within me.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup>&nbsp;I
 say that first it is appropriate to speak on the side of the soul (that
 is, of the old thought) and then of the other, for this reason: that 
what the speaker intends above all to stress must be reserved for the 
last, because what is said last remains most in the mind of the 
listener. Consequently since I intend to say and speak more about that 
which the work of those beings whom I address does than that which it 
undoes, it was reasonable first to mention and discuss the condition of 
the side which was being destroyed, and afterwards of that which was 
being brought to birth.</p>
<p>Here, however, arises a doubt which cannot be passed over without 
clarification. Someone might ask: “Since love is the effect of these 
Intelligences whom I address, and the former thought was love as much as
 the latter, why does their power destroy the one and give birth to the 
other, since it should rather preserve the former, for the reason that 
every cause loves its own effect, and, loving the one, preserves the 
other?” This question may easily be answered by saying that their effect
 is love, as has been said; and since they cannot preserve it except in 
those subjects which come under the influence of their revolution, they 
transfer it from that region which is outside of their power to that 
which is within it, that is to say, from the soul departed from this 
life to the soul which is still in it; just as human nature transfers 
its own preservation in the human form from father to son, because it 
cannot preserve its effect perpetually in the father. I say “effect” in 
that the soul conjoined with the body is its effect; for the soul, once 
it is departed, endures perpetually in a nature which is more than 
human. Thus the question is settled.</p>
<p>But since the immortality of the soul has been touched on here, I 
will make a digression and discuss this topic; for with this discussion 
it will be well to finish speaking of that blessed living Beatrice, of 
whom as a matter of purpose I do not intend to speak further in this 
work. I say that of all the follies the most foolish, the basest, and 
the most pernicious is the belief that beyond this life there is no 
other; for, if we look through all the books of both the philosophers 
and the other sages who have written on this topic, they all agree in 
this: that there is some part of us which is immortal. Aristotle seems 
to confirm this above all in his book&nbsp;<i>On the Soul</i>; every Stoic seems above all to confirm this; Tully seems to confirm this, especially in his short book&nbsp;<i>On Old Age</i>;
 every poet who has spoken according to the pagan faith seems to confirm
 this; every creed confirms this–whether Jews, Saracens, Tartars, or 
whoever else lives according to any principle of reason. If all of these
 were in error, there would exist an impossibility too horrible even to 
relate. Everyone is certain that human nature is the most perfect of all
 natures here below. No one denies this, and Aristotle affirms it when 
he says in the twelfth book&nbsp;<i>On the Animals&nbsp;</i>that man is the most perfect of all the animals.<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup>&nbsp;Consequently
 since many living creatures are entirely mortal, as for example the 
brute beasts, and all are, while they are alive, without this hope (that
 is, of another life), if our hope were vain, the defect in us would be 
greater than in any other animal, because many people have already lived
 who have given up this life for the other. So it would follow that the 
most perfect animal, namely man, was the most imperfect–which is 
impossible–and that that part which is his greatest perfection, namely 
reason, was the cause of the greatest defect in him–which seems a very 
strange thing to say.</p>
<p>Moreover, it would follow that nature had placed this hope within the
 human mind in opposition to itself, since it has been said that many 
have hastened the death of the body in order to live in the other life; 
and this is likewise impossible.</p>
<p>Moreover, we see continual proof of our immortality in the 
divinations of our dreams, which we could not have if there were not 
some immortal part within us, since the revealer, whether corporeal or 
incorporeal, must necessarily be immortal, if we give the matter careful
 thought–and I say “corporeal or incorporeal” because of the diversity 
of opinion which I find on this point; and that which is set in motion 
by or receives its form directly from an informing agent must stand in 
proportion to the informing agent, and between the mortal and the 
immortal there is no proportion.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are made certain of this by the most truthful teaching 
of Christ, which is the way, the truth, and the light: the way, because 
by it we proceed without impediment to the happiness of this 
immortality; the truth, because it is not subject to error; the light, 
because it illuminates us in the darkness of earthly ignorance. This 
teaching, I say, makes us certain above all other reasons, for he has 
given it to us who sees and measures our immortality, which we cannot 
see perfectly while our immortal part is mixed with our mortal part; but
 we see it perfectly by faith, and by reason we see it with a shadow of 
obscurity, which happens because of the mixture of the mortal with the 
immortal. This should be the strongest argument that there exist in us 
the one and the other; and I therefore believe, affirm, and am certain 
that I shall pass to another and better life after this one, where that 
lady lives in glory, of whom my soul was enamored when I was caught up 
in my struggle, as will be discussed in the following chapter.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="09"></a>Chapter 9</i></b></p>
<p>Returning to the subject, I say that in the stanza which begins&nbsp;<i>The humble thought</i>,
 I intend to reveal what my soul discoursed within me–that is, the old 
thought in opposition to the new. First I briefly reveal the cause of 
her sorrowful words when I say&nbsp;<i>The humble thought that used to speak to me Of an angel who is crowned in heaven Encounters now a foe who slays it</i>. This is that special thought of which it is said above that it was once&nbsp;<i>The life of my grieving heart</i>. Then when I say&nbsp;<i>The soul cries out, for this still grieves her</i>,
 I show that my soul is still on its side and speaks with sadness; and I
 say that she speaks words while lamenting, almost as if she were amazed
 at the sudden transformation, saying:&nbsp;<i>Alas, how he is fled, The compassionate one who once consoled me</i>. Well may she say “consoled,” for in her great loss this thought, which ascended to heaven, had given her much consolation.</p>
<p>Then afterwards to excuse her I say that all my thought (that is, the
 soul), which I call this anguished one, turns and speaks against my 
eyes; and this is made manifest by the words&nbsp;<i>And of my eyes this anguished one remarks</i>.
 And I tell how she says three things about them and against them. The 
first is that she curses the hour when this lady looked on them. Here it
 should be known that although many things can enter the eye at the same
 time, nevertheless that which enters along a straight line into the 
center of the pupil is the only one that is truly seen and which stamps 
itself upon the imagination. This is because the nerve along which the 
visual spirit runs is pointed in this direction; and therefore one eye 
cannot really look into another eye without being seen by it; for just 
as the one which looks receives the form in the pupil along a straight 
line, so along that same line its own form proceeds into the one it 
looks at; and many times along the extension of this line is discharged 
the bow of him against whom all arms are light. Therefore when I say 
that&nbsp;<i>such a lady looked on them</i>, it is as much as to say that her eyes and mine looked upon one another.</p>
<p>The second thing she says is that she reprimands their disobedience, when she says&nbsp;<i>Why would they not believe my word of her?</i>&nbsp;Then
 she proceeds to the third, saying that she should not reproach herself,
 as though she had not foreseen, but should reproach them for not having
 obeyed, since she says that on occasion in speaking of this lady she 
would say: In her eyes would reside power over me, if she opened the 
pathway to it; and this she says with the words&nbsp;<i>And I: `Now surely in her eyes</i>.’
 And indeed we must believe that my soul knew that its own disposition 
was capable of receiving the actuality of this lady, and therefore 
feared her; for the actuality of the agent is apprehended in the patient
 disposed toward it, as the Philosopher says in the second book of&nbsp;<i>On the Soul</i>.<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup>And
 therefore if wax had the spirit of fear, it would more greatly fear 
encountering the rays of the sun than would a stone, because its 
disposition receives the rays with greater efficacy.</p>
<p>Finally the soul makes manifest in her discourse that the eyes’ presumption endangered them, when she says&nbsp;<i>But my perceiving this did not avail, For still they gazed on him, whereby I’m slain</i>; she says&nbsp;<i>gazed on him</i>, on the one about whom she had earlier said&nbsp;<i>the one who slays the likes of me.</i>&nbsp;With this she ends her words, to which the new thought replies, as will be explained in the following chapter.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="10"></a>Chapter 10</i></b></p>
<p>We have thus explained the meaning of the part in which the soul 
speaks (that is, of the old thought which was destroyed). Subsequently 
the meaning of the part in which the new and opposing thought speaks 
must now be explained; and this part is completely contained in the 
stanza which begins&nbsp;<i>You are not slain</i>. To be correctly 
understood, this part must be divided in two: in the first part the 
opposing thought reprimands the soul for cowardice; and later in the 
second, beginning with the words&nbsp;<i>See how compassionate she is</i>, he declares what this reprimanded soul must do.</p>
<p>He says then, continuing from her last words: it is not true that you
 are slain; but the reason that you seem to be slain is the bewilderment
 into which you have fallen so abjectly for this lady who has appeared. 
Here it must be noted that, as Boethius says in his&nbsp;<i>Consolation</i>, “no sudden change in things can take place without some perturbation of the mind.”<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup>&nbsp;This
 is the meaning of the reprimand made by this thought, which is called a
 “little spirit of love,” to indicate that my consent inclined towards 
him; and so we can understand this all the better and recognize his 
victory, since he already says “our soul,” thereby making himself 
intimate with her. Then as has been said, he declares what this 
reprimanded soul must do in order to come to him, and he says to 
her&nbsp;<i>See how compassionate she is, and humble</i>, for the 
appropriate remedy to fear, by which the soul seems possessed, consists 
of two things; and these, especially when joined, are what cause a 
person to have good hope, and above all compassion, which makes every 
other goodness shine with its light. This is why Vergil, in speaking of 
Aeneas, sings his greatest praise by calling him compassionate. And 
compassion is not what the common people think it is, namely, grieving 
over another’s misfortune, which is one of its special effects that is 
called pity, and is an emotion. Compassion, however, is not an emotion, 
but rather a noble disposition of the mind, ready to receive love, pity,
 and other emotions arising out of charity.</p>
<p>Then he says: See also how she is&nbsp;<i>courteous and wise in her magnificence</i>.
 Here he speaks of three things which, among those that can be acquired 
by us, especially make a person pleasing. He says “wise”: now what is 
more beautiful in a woman than to be wise? He says “courteous”: nothing 
is more becoming in a woman than courtesy. And the wretches of the 
common herd should not be deceived as well by this word, thinking 
courtesy nothing other than liberality; for liberality is a special, not
 a general, kind of courtesy! Courtesy and dignity are one and the same;
 and because in the courts in times past virtue and fine manners were 
practiced, just as the contrary is now the case, this word was derived 
from courts and “courtesy” was as much as to say “the custom of the 
court.” If this word were derived from the courts of the present day, 
especially those of Italy, it would mean nothing but rudeness.</p>
<p>He says&nbsp;<i>in her magnificence</i>. Temporal greatness, which is
 meant here, is most of all becoming when accompanied by the two 
previously mentioned goodnesses, because it is the light which clearly 
reveals the good and its opposite in a person. How much wisdom and how 
much habit of virtue go unnoticed for lack of this light! How much 
stupidity and how many vices are discerned by possessing this light! It 
would be better for the wretched, stupid, foolish, and despicable nobles
 to dwell in low estate, for neither in this world nor in the afterlife 
would they be so disgraced. Indeed it is for them that Solomon says in 
Ecclesiastes: “There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun,
 namely riches preserved for their owner’s ruin.”<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup>&nbsp;Then
 he subsequently compels her, my soul that is, to call this one her 
lady, promising her that she will be gladdened by this when she becomes 
aware of her adornments; and this he says with the words&nbsp;<i>Unless you err through self-deceit you’ll see</i>.
 Nor does he say anything else for the remainder of this stanza. This 
completes the literal meaning of all that I say in this canzone in 
addressing these celestial Intelligences.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="11"></a>Chapter 11</i></b></p>
<p>Finally, as the letter of this commentary stated above when it 
divided this canzone into its principal parts, I address my discourse 
directly to the canzone itself, and speak to it. In order that this may 
be more fully understood, I say that in every canzone this is generally 
called a “tornata,” because the poets who first made a practice of 
employing it did so in order that when the canzone had been sung they 
might return to it with a certain part of the melody.<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup>&nbsp;But
 I have rarely employed it with that intention, and so that others might
 perceive that this is the case, rarely have I composed it according to 
the metrical pattern of the canzone, with regard to the number of verses
 which are required for the melody; but I have employed it for the 
adornment of the canzone when there was a need to say something lying 
outside its meaning, as may be seen in this one and in the others. 
Therefore I say here that the goodness and the beauty of every discourse
 are separate and different from one another; for goodness lies in the 
meaning, and beauty in the adornment of the words; and both the one and 
the other give pleasure, although goodness is especially pleasing. And 
so, since the goodness of this canzone was difficult to perceive because
 of the diversity of persons in it who are presented as speakers, where 
many distinctions are required, and since its beauty was easy to 
perceive, it seemed to me necessary for the canzone that others consider
 its beauty more than its goodness. And this is what I say in this part.</p>
<p>But since it often happens that an admonition appears presumptuous, a
 rhetorician is accustomed in certain circumstances to speak to people 
indirectly, addressing his words not to the person for whom they are 
meant, but to another. This method is in fact adopted here, for the 
words are addressed to the canzone and their meaning to men. I say 
therefore, “My song, I think they will be few indeed,” that is to say 
quite few, “who understand you well.” And I give the reason, which is 
twofold. First, because your speech is complex–I say “complex” for the 
reason that has been mentioned; and second, because your speech is 
difficult–I say “difficult” with regard to the newness of the meaning. 
Now afterwards I admonish it and say: So if by chance it comes to pass 
that you should find yourself with some who appear perplexed by your 
argument, do not be dismayed, but say to them: Since you do not perceive
 my goodness, consider at least how fair I am. For I mean nothing by 
this, as has been said above, save: You men who cannot perceive the 
meaning of this canzone, do not therefore reject it; rather consider its
 beauty, which is great by virtue of its composition, which is the 
concern of the grammarians, by virtue of the order of its discourse, 
which is the concern of the rhetoricians, and by the virtue of the 
rhythm of its parts, which is the concern of the musicians. These things
 can be perceived within it as beautiful by anyone who looks closely.</p>
<p>This is the complete literal meaning of the first canzone, which, as has been indicated above, constitutes the first course.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="12"></a>Chapter 12</i></b></p>
<p>Now that the literal meaning has been sufficiently explained, we must
 proceed to the allegorical and true exposition. Therefore, beginning 
again from the beginning, I say that when I lost the first delight of my
 soul, of which mention is made above, I was pierced by such sorrow that
 no comfort availed me.<sup><a href="#N_33_">(33)</a></sup>&nbsp;Nevertheless
 after some time my mind, which was endeavoring to heal itself, resolved
 (since neither my own consolation nor that of others availed) to resort
 to a method which a certain disconsolate individual had adopted to 
console himself; and I began to read that book of Boethius, not known to
 many, in which, while a prisoner and an exile, he had found 
consolation.<sup><a href="#N_34_">(34)</a></sup>&nbsp;And hearing 
further that Tully had written another book in which, while discussing 
Friendship, he had addressed words of consolation to Laelius, a man of 
the highest merit, upon the death of his friend Scipio, I set about 
reading it.<sup><a href="#N_35_">(35)</a></sup>&nbsp;Although it was 
difficult for me at first to penetrate their meaning, I finally 
penetrated it as deeply as my command of Latin and the small measure of 
my intellect enabled me to do, by which intellect I had perceived many 
things before, as in a dream, as may be seen in the&nbsp;<i>New Life</i>.</p>
<p>And just as it often happens that a man goes looking for silver and 
apart from his intention finds gold, which some hidden cause presents, 
perhaps not without divine ordinance, so I who sought to console myself 
found not only a remedy for my tears but also the words of authors, 
sciences, and books. Pondering these, I quickly determined that 
Philosophy, who was the lady of these authors, sciences, and books, was a
 great thing. I imagined her fashioned as a gentle lady, and I could not
 imagine her in any attitude except one of compassion, so that the part 
of my mind that perceives truth gazed on her so willingly that I could 
barely turn it away from her. I began to go where she was truly 
revealed, namely to the schools of the religious orders and to the 
disputations held by the philosophers, so that in a short period of 
time, perhaps some thirty months, I began to feel her sweetness so much 
that the love of her dispelled and destroyed every other thought.</p>
<p>Consequently, feeling myself raised from the thought of that first 
love to the virtue of this one, almost in amazement I opened my mouth to
 speak the words of the canzone before us, revealing my condition 
beneath the figure of other things, because no rhyme in any vernacular 
was worthy to treat openly of the lady of whom I was enamored; nor were 
the listeners so well prepared that they would have understood the 
fictive words so easily; nor would they have given credence to their 
true meaning, as they did to the fictive, because in fact they fully 
believed that I was disposed toward this love, and not, as they 
believed, to the other. I began therefore to say&nbsp;<i>You whose intellect the third sphere moves</i>.
 Since this lady, as has been said, was the daughter of God, queen of 
all things, most noble and beautiful Philosophy, we must consider who 
were these movers and this third heaven. And first I will speak of the 
heaven, according to the order already employed. Here it will not be 
necessary to proceed by dividing and explaining the text word by word; 
for, by turning the fictive words from what they say into what they 
mean, the meaning will be sufficiently clear from the exposition already
 given.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="13"></a>Chapter 13</i></b></p>
<p>To see what is meant by the third heaven we must first see what I 
mean by the word “heaven” itself; and then it will be seen how and why 
it was necessary to speak of this third heaven. I say that by heaven I 
mean “science” and by heavens “the sciences,” because of three kinds of 
similarity that the heavens have above all with the sciences, and by the
 order and number in which they seem to agree, as will be seen in 
speaking of the word “third.”</p>
<p>The first kind of similarity consists of the revolution of the one 
and the other around something that is motionless with respect to it. 
For each moving heaven turns on its center, which is not moved by the 
motion of the heaven; and likewise each science moves around its 
subject, without moving it, because no science demonstrates its own 
subject, but presupposes it.</p>
<p>The second similarity is the illuminating power of the one and the 
other; for each heaven illuminates visible things, and likewise each 
science illuminates things that are intelligible.</p>
<p>The third similarity consists of bringing about perfection in those 
things disposed thereto. Concerning the bringing about of perfection, 
insofar as the first perfection is concerned, namely substantial 
generation, all philosophers agree that the heavens are the cause, 
although they explain it differently, some imputing it to the movers, as
 do Plato, Avicenna, and Algazel; some to the stars themselves, 
especially in the case of human souls, as do Socrates and also Plato and
 Dionysius the Academician; and some to celestial virtue which is in the
 natural heat of the seed, as do Aristotle and the other Peripatetics. 
Similarly, the sciences are the cause in us of bringing about the second
 perfection, by the possession of which we are able to contemplate the 
truth, which is our ultimate perfection, as the Philosopher says in the 
sixth book of the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>&nbsp;when he says that truth is the
 good of the intellect. Because of these as well as many other kinds of 
similarity, science may be called “heaven.”</p>
<p>Now it remains to be seen why “third” heaven is said. For this it is 
necessary to give consideration to a comparison that obtains between the
 order of the heavens and that of the sciences. As was stated above, 
then, the seven heavens nearest to us are those of the planets; next 
come two heavens above them, which are in motion, and one above them 
all, which is still. To the first seven correspond the seven sciences of
 the Trivium and the Quadrivium, namely Grammar, Dialectics, Rhetoric, 
Arithmetic, Music, Geometry, and Astrology. To the eighth sphere, namely
 the Starry Heaven, corresponds natural science, which is called 
Physics, and the first science, which is called Metaphysics; to the 
ninth sphere corresponds Moral Science; and to the still heaven 
corresponds Divine Science, which is called Theology. And the reason why
 this is so must be briefly considered.</p>
<p>I say that the heaven of the Moon resembles Grammar because it may be
 compared to it; for if the Moon is closely examined, two things will be
 seen peculiar to it which are not seen in the other stars: one is the 
shadow in it, which is nothing but the rarity of its substance in which 
the rays of the Sun cannot terminate and be reflected back as in its 
other parts; the other is the variation of its luminosity, which shines 
now on one side, now on the other, according as the Sun looks upon it.<sup><a href="#N_36_">(36)</a></sup>&nbsp;These
 two properties Grammar possesses; for because of its infinitude the 
rays of reason are not terminated, especially in the particular of 
words; and it shines now on this side, now on that, insofar as certain 
words, certain declensions, and certain constructions are now in use 
which formerly were not, and many were formerly in use which will yet be
 in use again, as Horace says at the beginning of his&nbsp;<i>Poetics</i>, when he says: “Many words shall be born which have long since fallen out of use.”<sup><a href="#N_37_">(37)</a></sup></p>
<p>The heaven of Mercury may be compared to Dialectics because of two 
properties: for Mercury is the smallest star of heaven, because the 
magnitude of its diameter is not more than 232 miles, according to 
Alfraganus, who says it is 1/28th of the diameter of the earth, which is
 6500 miles; the other property is that in its passage it is veiled by 
the rays of the sun more than any other star. These two properties are 
found in Dialectics, for Dialectics is less in substance than any other 
science, for it is entirely constituted by and contained within that 
text alone which is found in the Old Art and in the New; and its passage
 is veiled more than that of any science, in that it proceeds by a more 
sophistical and polemical mode of argument than any other.</p>
<p>The heaven of Venus may be compared to Rhetoric because of two 
properties: one is the brightness of its aspect, which is sweeter to 
look upon than that of any other star; the other is its appearance now 
in the morning, now in the evening. And these two properties are found 
in Rhetoric: for Rhetoric is sweeter than all of the other sciences, 
since this is what it principally aims at; and it appears in the morning
 when the rhetorician speaks before the face of his hearer, and it 
appears in the evening (that is, behind) when the rhetorician speaks 
through writing, from a distance.</p>
<p>The heaven of the Sun may be compared to Arithmetic because of two 
properties: one is that all the other stars are informed by its light; 
the other is that the eye cannot look at it. And these two properties 
are found in Arithmetic: for by its light all sciences are illuminated, 
because all their subjects are considered under some numerical aspect, 
and in considering them we always proceed by number. For example, in 
Natural Science, the subject is a body in motion, which body in motion 
has in itself the principle of continuity, and this has in itself the 
principle of infinite number; and its foremost consideration is to 
consider the principles of natural things, which are three–namely 
matter, privation, and form–in which we perceive this numerical aspect. 
Number exists not only in all of them together, but also, upon careful 
reflection, in each one individually; for this reason Pythagoras, as 
Aristotle says in the first book of the&nbsp;<i>Physics</i>, laid down even and odd as the principles of natural things, considering all things to have numerical aspect.<sup><a href="#N_38_">(38)</a></sup>&nbsp;The
 other property of the Sun is also seen in number, of which Arithmetic 
is the science: the eye of the intellect cannot look upon it, because 
number insofar as it is considered in itself is infinite, and this we 
cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>The heaven of Mars may be compared to music because of two 
properties: one is its most beautiful relation, for in counting the 
moving heavens, from whichever we begin, whether from the lowest or the 
highest, this heaven of Mars is the fifth and the middlemost of them 
all, that is, of the first, second, third, and fourth pairs. The other, 
as Ptolemy says in the&nbsp;<i>Quadripartitus</i>, is that Mars dries things out and incinerates them because its heat is like that of fire;<sup><a href="#N_39_">(39)</a></sup>&nbsp;and
 this is why it appears fiery in color, sometimes more and sometimes 
less, according to the density or rarity of the vapors which accompany 
it, which often ignite by themselves, as is established in the first 
book of&nbsp;<i>Meteorics</i>.<sup><a href="#N_40_">(40)</a></sup>&nbsp;For
 this reason Albumassar says that the ignition of these vapors signifies
 the death of kings and the changing of kingdoms, because they are 
effects of the lordship of Mars, and this is why Seneca says that at the
 death of the Emperor Augustus he saw on high a ball of fire. This is 
also why in Florence, at the beginning of its ruin, there was seen in 
the sky in the shape of a cross a great quantity of these vapors which 
accompany the star of Mars. And these two properties are found in Music,
 which consists entirely of relations, as we see in harmonized words and
 in songs, whose harmony is so much the sweeter the more the relation is
 beautiful, which relation is the principal beauty in this science, 
because it is its principal aim. Moreover, Music attracts to itself the 
human spirits, which are, as it were, principally vapors of the heart, 
so that they almost completely cease their activity; this happens 
likewise to the entire soul when it hears music, and the virtue of all 
of them, as it were, runs to the spirit of sense which receives the 
sound.</p>
<p>The heaven of Jupiter may be compared to Geometry because of two 
properties: one is that it moves between two heavens that are 
antithetical to its fine temperance, namely that of Mars and that of 
Saturn; consequently Ptolemy says, in the book referred to, that Jupiter
 is a star of temperate constitution between the cold of Saturn and the 
heat of Mars; the other is that among all the stars it appears white, 
almost silvery. And these things are found in the science of Geometry. 
Geometry moves between two things antithetical to it, namely the point 
and the circle–and I mean “circle” in the broad sense of anything round,
 whether a solid body or a surface; for, as Euclid says, the point is 
its beginning, and, as he says, the circle is its most perfect figure, 
which must therefore be conceived as its end. Therefore Geometry moves 
between the point and the circle as between its beginning and end, and 
these two are antithetical to its certainty; for the point cannot be 
measured because of its indivisibility, and it is impossible to square 
the circle perfectly because of its arc, and so it cannot be measured 
exactly.<sup><a href="#N_41_">(41)</a>&nbsp;</sup>Geometry is 
furthermore most white insofar as it is without taint of error and most 
certain both in itself and in its handmaid, which is called Optics.</p>
<p>The heaven of Saturn has two properties by which it may be compared 
to Astrology: one is the slowness of its movement through the 12 signs, 
for according to the writings of the astrologers, a time of more than 29
 years is required for its revolution; the other is that it is high 
above all the other planets.<sup><a href="#N_42_">(42)</a></sup>&nbsp;And
 these two properties are found in Astrology: for in completing its 
circle (that is to say, to master this science) a very great span of 
time passes, both because of its handmaids, which are more numerous than
 those of any of the above-mentioned sciences, and because of the 
experience required in it for making proper judgments. Furthermore, it 
is far higher than all the others, since, as Aristotle says at the 
beginning of&nbsp;<i>On the Soul</i>, a science is high in nobility by 
virtue of the nobility of its subject and by virtue of its certainty; 
and this one, more than any of those mentioned above, is high and noble 
because of its high and noble subject, which regards the movement of the
 heaven, and high and noble because of its certainty, which is flawless,
 as coming from a most perfect and regular principle. And if anyone 
believes that there is a flaw in it, it does not pertain to the science,
 but as Ptolemy says, it results from our negligence, and so must be 
attributed to that.<sup><a href="#N_43_">(43)</a></sup></p>
<p><b><i><a name="14"></a>Chapter 14</i></b></p>
<p>After having made these comparisons concerning the first seven 
heavens, we must proceed to the others, which are three, as has several 
times been stated. I say that the Starry Heaven may be compared to 
Physics because of three properties, and to Metaphysics because of three
 others: for it displays to us two visible objects, namely the multitude
 of stars and the Galaxy, that is, that white circle which the common 
people call Saint Jacob’s Way; and it discloses one of its poles to us 
and keeps the other hidden; and it discloses one of its movements to us,
 from east to west, and keeps the other, which it makes from west to 
east, almost hidden from us.<sup><a href="#N_44_">(44)</a></sup>&nbsp;Consequently proceeding in order we must consider first the comparison to Physics and then the one to Metaphysics.</p>
<p>I say that the Starry Heaven manifests many stars to us, for 
according to what the wise men of Egypt have observed, including the 
last star that appears to them in the south, they count 1022 starry 
bodies, and it is of them that I speak. In this respect it has a very 
great resemblance with Physics, if we consider very closely these three 
numbers: namely two, twenty, and a thousand. For by two we understand 
local movement, which is necessarily from one point to another. By 
twenty is signified the movement by alteration, for since we cannot 
proceed beyond ten without altering ten itself by means of the other 
nine or itself, and since the most beautiful alteration which it 
receives is its own alteration by itself; and since the first alteration
 occurs at twenty, it is reasonable that the above-mentioned movement 
should be signified by this number. By a thousand is signified the 
movement of growth; for this “thousand” is the largest number that has a
 name, and there can be no further growth except by multiplying it. And 
Physics manifests only these three movements, as is proved in the fifth 
book of the first group of books.<sup><a href="#N_45_">(45)</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of the Galaxy this heaven has a great resemblance to 
Metaphysics. Hence it should be known that concerning this Galaxy 
philosophers have held different opinions. For the Pythagoreans said 
that the Sun at one time strayed from its path, and, passing through 
other regions unsuited to its burning heat, set aflame the place through
 which it passed, leaving there traces of that conflagration. I believe 
they were influenced by the fable of Phaëton, which Ovid recounts at the
 beginning of the second book of the&nbsp;<i>Metamorphoses</i>.<sup><a href="#N_46_">(46)</a></sup>&nbsp;Others,
 as for example Anaxagoras and Democritus, said that it was the light of
 the Sun reflected in that region, and they refuted the other opinions 
by demonstrative reasoning. What Aristotle said on this matter cannot be
 known with certainty because his opinion is not the same in one 
translation as in another. I believe that this is due to an error on the
 part of the translators; for in the New Translation he seems to say 
that it is a collection of vapors beneath the stars in that region, 
which attracts them continuously; this does not seem to have any 
foundation in truth.<sup><a href="#N_47_">(47)</a></sup>&nbsp;In the Old
 Translation he says that the Galaxy is nothing but a multitude of fixed
 stars in that region, so small that we are unable to distinguish them 
from here below, though from them originates the appearance of that 
brightness which we call the Galaxy; this may be so, for the heaven in 
that region is denser, and therefore retains and throws back this light.
 Avicenna and Ptolemy seem to share this opinion with Aristotle. 
Consequently, since the Galaxy is an effect of those stars which we 
cannot see, except that we understand these things by their effects, and
 Metaphysics treats of the primal substances, which we likewise cannot 
understand except by their effects, it is clear that the Starry Heaven 
bears a great resemblance to Metaphysics.</p>
<p>Moreover, the pole which we see signifies the sensible things, which,
 taking them as a whole, Physics treats; and the pole which we do not 
see signifies the things that are immaterial, which are not sensible, 
which Metaphysics treats; and therefore the aforesaid heaven bears a 
great resemblance to the one science and to the other. Moreover, by its 
two movements it signifies these two sciences. For by the movement with 
which each day it revolves and completes a new circuit from point to 
point, it signifies the corruptible things of nature, which day by day 
complete their course, their matter changing from form to form; and 
these Physics treats. By the almost imperceptible movement which it 
makes from west to east at the rate of one degree in a hundred years, it
 signifies the incorruptible things which had their beginning through 
creation by God and shall have no end; and these Metaphysics treats. 
Therefore I say that this movement signifies these things, because this 
revolution had a beginning and shall have no end, for the end of a 
revolution consists of returning to the same point, to which this 
heaven, according to its movement, shall never return. For since the 
beginning of the world it has completed little more than one-sixth of 
the revolution, and yet we are already in the last age of the world and 
are still awaiting the consummation of the celestial movement. So it is 
manifest that the Starry Heaven, because of many properties, can be 
compared to Physics and to Metaphysics.</p>
<p>The Crystalline Heaven, which has previously been designated as the 
Primum Mobile, has a very clear resemblance to Moral Philosophy; for 
Moral Philosophy, as Thomas says in commenting on the second book of 
the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>, disposes us properly to the other sciences.<sup><a href="#N_48_">(48)</a></sup>For, as the Philosopher says in the fifth book of the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>,
 “legal justice disposes the sciences for our learning, and commands 
that they be learned and taught in order that they not be forsaken”;<sup><a href="#N_49_">(49)</a></sup>&nbsp;so
 with its movement the aforesaid heaven governs the daily revolution of 
all the others, by which every day they all receive and transmit here 
below the virtue of all their parts; for if the revolution of this 
heaven did not govern in this way, little of their virtue would reach 
here below, and little sight of them as well. Consequently if we suppose
 that it were possible for this ninth heaven not to move, there is no 
place on earth from which a third of the Starry Heaven could as yet have
 been seen; and Saturn would be hidden for 14 ½ years, from any given 
place on earth, and Jupiter would be hidden for 6 years, and Mars for 
almost a year, and the Sun 182 days and 14 hours (I say “days,” meaning 
the length of time which is measured by so many days), and Venus and 
Mercury would be hidden and visible almost as long as the Sun, and the 
Moon would be concealed from all mankind for a period of 14 ½ days. In 
truth there would be no generation here below, either of animal or of 
plant life; there would be no night or day, or week or month or year, 
but rather all the universe would be disordered, and the movement of the
 other heavens would be in vain. Likewise if Moral Philosophy ceased to 
exist, the other sciences would be hidden for some time, and there would
 be no generation or happiness in life, and in vain would these bodies 
of knowledge have been discovered and written down long ago. 
Consequently it is quite evident that this heaven may be compared to 
Moral Philosophy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Empyrean Heaven by its peace resembles the Divine 
Science, which is full of all peace and suffers no diversity of opinion 
or sophistical reasoning because of the supreme certainty of its 
subject, which is God. Christ says of this science to his disciples: “My
 peace I give to you, my peace I leave with you,” giving and leaving to 
them his teaching, which is this science of which I speak.<sup><a href="#N_50_">(50)</a></sup>&nbsp;Solomon,
 speaking of this science, says: “The queens number sixty, and the 
concubines eighty; and of the young handmaids there is no number: one is
 my dove and my perfect one.”<sup><a href="#N_51_">(51)</a></sup>&nbsp;He
 calls all sciences queens and friends and handmaids, but this one he 
calls perfect because it makes us see truth perfectly, in which our 
souls find rest.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the comparison of the heavens to the sciences has 
been discussed, we may perceive that by the third heaven I mean 
Rhetoric, which resembles the third heaven, as is clear from above.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="15"></a>Chapter 15</i></b></p>
<p>By the resemblances discussed it may be seen who are these movers to 
whom I speak, who are the movers of this heaven, like Boethius and 
Tully, who with the sweetness of their discourse guided me, as has been 
said above, along the path of love–that is, into the pursuit of this 
most gentle lady Philosophy, by the rays of their star, which is their 
writing about her; for in every science the written word is a star 
filled with light which reveals that science. Once this is understood, 
we may perceive the true meaning of the first stanza of the canzone 
before us by means of the fictive and literal exposition.<sup><a href="#N_52_">(52)</a></sup>&nbsp;By means of this same exposition the second stanza may be sufficiently understood, as far as the part where it says&nbsp;<i>This one makes me behold a lady</i>.</p>
<p>Here we must observe that this lady is Philosophy, who truly is a 
lady full of sweetness, adorned with honor, wondrous in wisdom, glorious
 in freedom, as will be made manifest in the third book, which will 
treat her nobleness. And where it says&nbsp;<i>Let him who would see bliss Gaze into the eyes of this lady</i>,
 the eyes of this lady are her demonstrations, which when directed into 
the eyes of the intellect, enamor the soul that is liberated from its 
earthly condition. O most sweet and ineffable looks, sudden captors of 
the human mind, who appear in the demonstrations of the eyes of 
Philosophy when she converses with her lovers! Truly in you is 
salvation, by which he who gazes on you is made blessed and saved from 
the death of ignorance and vice. Where it is said&nbsp;<i>Provided he fears not the sighs of anguish</i>,
 we must understand provided he fears not the strain of study and the 
turmoil of uncertainty which spring forth in profusion from this lady’s 
first glances, and then, as her light continues, fall away like morning 
clouds before the face of the sun, so that the intellect becomes 
accustomed to her and remains free and full of certainty, like the air 
that is purged and made luminous by the midday rays.</p>
<p>The third stanza is likewise understood by means of the literal exposition up to where it says&nbsp;<i>The soul cries out</i>.
 Here we must carefully attend to a certain moral which may be noted in 
these words: that a man should not, for the sake of a greater friend, 
forget the services rendered by a lesser one; but if indeed he must 
follow the one and forsake the other, he should follow the better one, 
abandoning the other with some honest expression of regret, whereby he 
gives to the one he follows cause for greater love. Then where it 
says&nbsp;<i>And of my eyes</i>, it means that difficult was the hour in
 which the first demonstration of this lady entered the eyes of my 
intellect, which was the most immediate cause of this love. Where it 
says&nbsp;<i>the likes of me</i>&nbsp;is meant the souls that are free 
from wretched and vile delights and from vulgar habits, and endowed with
 intellect and memory. Then it says&nbsp;<i>slays</i>, and then&nbsp;<i>I’m slain</i>,
 which seems contrary to what has been said above of this lady’s power 
to save. Therefore it should be known that one of the sides speaks here,
 and the other there, the two contending diversely, as has been made 
clear above. Hence it is not surprising that the one says “yes” and the 
other “no,” if we note carefully which is falling and which is rising.</p>
<p>Then in the fourth stanza where it says&nbsp;<i>a gentle spirit of love</i>,
 it means a thought that is born of my study. Here it should be known 
that by love in this allegory is always meant that study which is the 
application of the mind to that thing of which it is enamored. Then when
 it says&nbsp;<i>you will See the beauty of such lofty miracles</i>, it 
declares that through her shall the beauty of these miracles be 
perceived; and it speaks truly, for the beauty of wonders is the 
perception of their causes which she demonstrates, as the Philosopher 
seems to assert at the beginning of the&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics&nbsp;</i>when
 he says that by the sight of these beauties men began to fall in love 
with this lady. We will speak more fully of this word “wonder” in the 
following book. All the rest that follows in this canzone has been made 
sufficiently clear by the previous exposition. So at the end of this 
second book I assert and affirm that the lady of whom I was enamored 
after my first love was the most beautiful and honorable daughter of the
 Emperor of the universe, to whom Pythagoras gave the name of 
Philosophy.</p>
<p>Here ends the second book, whose purpose has been to explicate the canzone which is served as the first course.<sup><a href="#N_53_">(53)</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="N_1_"></a>1.&nbsp;<i>the usage of the poets</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 What Dante means in distinguishing between the allegory of the poets 
and the allegory of the theologians is not entirely clear and has given 
rise to endless speculation. The theologians insist on the veracity of 
all four levels of meaning, and conceived of the allegorical levels (the
 typological, tropological, and anagogical) to depend on a literal level
 which was historically true. In the allegory of the poets, as 
exemplified by the allusion to the myth of Orpheus, the literal level is
 a “bella menzogna,” a beautiful fiction having no basis in historical 
reality. In the allegory of the theologians, moreover, the second level 
always refers to some aspect of Christ’s historical being, of which he 
is the ideal type, which is not the case with the poets. The third and 
fourth levels are shared in common by both modes of allegory.</p>
<p><a name="N_2_"></a>2.&nbsp;<i>he took with him but three</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The apostles Peter, James, and John (see Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9:1-7, Luke 9:28-36).</p>
<p><a name="N_3_"></a>3.&nbsp;<i>when the people of Israel went out of Egypt</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reference is to Psalm 113,&nbsp;<i>In exitu Israel de Egypto</i>. Dante employs this same psalm in his&nbsp;<i>Letter to Cangrande</i>&nbsp;to illustrate the various levels of allegory, and the souls of the saved sing this psalm entering Purgatory.</p>
<p><a name="N_4_"></a>4.&nbsp;<i>the Philosopher</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See St. Thomas’ commentary to&nbsp;<i>Phys</i>. I, lect. 1.</p>
<p><a name="N_5_"></a>5.&nbsp;<i>the star of Venus . . . that circle of hers</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The planets were considered stars that wandered through the heavens, in
 distinction to the Fixed Stars which were immovable and always appeared
 in the same position in the sky at all times of the year. Venus is a 
moving “star,” and the circle or orbit in which she moves in Dante’s 
description is her epicycle, a circle whose center lies on the main 
orbit which circles the earth, according to the Ptolemaic system.</p>
<p><a name="N_6_"></a>6.&nbsp;<i>when that gentle lady</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The “gentle lady” at the window who consoled Dante during his period of
 grief after the loss of Beatrice (see the&nbsp;<i>Vita Nuova</i>, 
XXXIV). The planet Venus circles the earth in 584 days, so that the 
period referred to is at least three years and two months after the 
death of Beatrice, which occurred on 8 June 1290.</p>
<p><a name="N_7_"></a>7.&nbsp;<i>which still held the citadel of my mind</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The struggle is between the old love for Beatrice and the new thought, 
his emergent love for Lady Philosophy, which assails it.</p>
<p><a name="N_8_"></a>8.&nbsp;<i>to excuse myself for the change</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The text here is defective. Simonelli reads&nbsp;<i>per iscusare me de la [novi]tade</i>, Busnelli-Vandelli has&nbsp;<i>v[a]ri[e]tade</i>, and Chiappelli-Fenzi have recently returned to the reading&nbsp;<i>veritade</i>&nbsp;(truth). Simonelli notes that Dante uses the very word&nbsp;<i>novitade</i>&nbsp;in the canzone’s first stanza, verse ten.</p>
<p><a name="N_9_"></a>9.&nbsp;<i>Later Ptolemy</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The model of the universe devised by Ptolemy, who flourished in Egypt 
around 140 A.D., was officially adopted by the Church of Rome. It is, of
 course, the model for Dante’s&nbsp;<i>Paradiso</i>.</p>
<p><a name="N_10_"></a>10.&nbsp;<i>the order of their position</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order of the spheres discussed here reappears in&nbsp;<i>Paradiso</i>.
 According to medieval astronomy, the planets were attached to great, 
transparent, empty shell-like spheres which carried them around the 
earth.</p>
<p><a name="N_11_"></a>11.&nbsp;<i>it is not itself in space</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Empyrean is beyond time and space; cf.&nbsp;<i>Par</i>. XXII, 64-67.</p>
<p><a name="N_12_"></a>12.&nbsp;<i>“Your magnificence . . .”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 8:1.</p>
<p><a name="N_13_"></a>13.&nbsp;<i>an epicycle</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 According to Ptolemaic cosmology, as Venus proceeds to circle the 
earth, it performs a second kind of circular movement, one whose center 
is situated on the circumference of its orbit around earth. This model 
was adopted to account for the fact the perceived motion of some planets
 did not accord with a simple revolution around the earth. Indeed, Venus
 and Mercury were observed to move in a retrograde motion at various 
times of the year. Dante will refer to the epicycle of Venus again at 
the beginning of&nbsp;<i>Paradiso</i>&nbsp;VIII.</p>
<p><a name="N_14_"></a>14.&nbsp;<i>separate substances</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beings that have a soul but no body, namely the Angels.</p>
<p><a name="N_15_"></a>15.&nbsp;<i>as the Apostle says</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul, Hebrews 1:1.</p>
<p><a name="N_16_"></a>16.&nbsp;<i>as John the Evangelist says</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John 1:5.</p>
<p><a name="N_17_"></a>17.&nbsp;<i>of whom Solomon says</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Song of Songs 8:5.</p>
<p><a name="N_18_"></a>18.&nbsp;<i>nine orders of spiritual creatures</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dante follows the order of angels established by Gregory the Great in Book XXXII of his&nbsp;<i>Moralia</i>. In&nbsp;<i>Paradiso</i>, he adopts the order proposed by Dionysius the Areopagite (see&nbsp;<i>Par</i>. XXVIII, 98-135): Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels, Angels.</p>
<p><a name="N_19_"></a>19.&nbsp;<i>a certain number were lost</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fallen angels, who became devils and populated Hell. See&nbsp;<i>Par</i>. XXIX, 49 and&nbsp;<i>Inf</i>. VII, 11-12.</p>
<p><a name="N_20_"></a>20.&nbsp;<i>“The heavens declare . . .”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 19:1 (King James Version).</p>
<p><a name="N_21_"></a>21.&nbsp;<i>“My son, my power, . . .”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aeneid</i>&nbsp;I, 664.</p>
<p><a name="N_22_"></a>22.&nbsp;<i>“My son, my arms, my power.”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Metamorphoses</i>&nbsp;V, 365.</p>
<p><a name="N_23_"></a>23.&nbsp;<i>the book of the Constellations of the Stars</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The text referred to is the&nbsp;<i>Liber de aggregationibus scientiae Stellarum</i>, by the ninth-century Arab astronomer Alfraganus.</p>
<p><a name="N_24_"></a>24.&nbsp;<i>for they have no sense perception</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The angels have no body and therefore no power of sensation. 
Consequently they have no power nor need of language, as Dante explains 
in the&nbsp;<i>De vulgari eloquentia</i>&nbsp;I, 2.</p>
<p><a name="N_25_"></a>25.&nbsp;<i>adorn this new lady</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<i>donna gentile</i>&nbsp;who consoled Dante immediately after the death of Beatrice (see the&nbsp;<i>Vita Nuova</i>, XXXV-XXXIX).</p>
<p><a name="N_26_"></a>26.&nbsp;<i>“He lives the life of an ass.”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>De consolatione philosophiae</i>&nbsp;IV, 3, 11.</p>
<p><a name="N_27_"></a>27.&nbsp;<i>the meaning of that part</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reference is to the third stanza.</p>
<p><a name="N_28_"></a>28.&nbsp;<i>in the twelfth book</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it is Book XIII.</p>
<p><a name="N_29_"></a>29.&nbsp;<i>in the second book of On the Soul</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II, 2.</p>
<p><a name="N_30_"></a>30.&nbsp;<i>“no sudden change . . .”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>De consolatione philosophiae</i>&nbsp;II, 1, 3.</p>

<p><a name="N_32_"></a>32.&nbsp;<i>it is generally called a “tornata”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<i>tornata</i>&nbsp;(return) is a Provençal term for the final short stanza of a poem.</p>
<p><a name="N_33_"></a>33.&nbsp;<i>the first delight of my soul</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Beatrice.</p>
<p><a name="N_34_"></a>34.&nbsp;<i>that book of Boethius</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>&nbsp;was
 composed by Boethius while in prison in Pavia in the year 523 A.D. 
Condemned to exile and death, he was executed in the following year. 
Dante must have seen in him an&nbsp;<i>alter ego</i>&nbsp;of his own being.</p>
<p><a name="N_35_"></a>35.&nbsp;<i>while discussing Friendship</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cicero’s&nbsp;<i>Laelius sive de amicitia (On Friendship)</i>.</p>
<p><a name="N_36_"></a>36.&nbsp;<i>the rarity of its substance</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The theory that the spots on the moon were the result of the varying 
density of lunar material from place to place, later rejected by Dante 
in&nbsp;<i>Par</i>. II, 61 ff. as false, derives from Averroes.</p>
<p><a name="N_37_"></a>37.&nbsp;<i>as Horace says</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ars poetica</i>, 70-71.</p>
<p><a name="N_38_"></a>38.&nbsp;<i>as Aristotle says in the first book of the Physics</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dante is referring to the commentary on the&nbsp;<i>Physics</i>&nbsp;by St. Thomas, I, 10.</p>
<p><a name="N_39_"></a>39.&nbsp;<i>as Ptolemy says in the Quadripartitus</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A treatise on astronomy by Claudius of Tolomea (Egypt) written in the third century A.D.</p>
<p><a name="N_40_"></a>40.&nbsp;<i>in the first book of Meteorics</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A work by Albert the Great; the reference is to Book I, 4, 9.</p>
<p><a name="N_41_"></a>41.&nbsp;<i>it is impossible to square the circle perfectly</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last simile of the&nbsp;<i>Divine Comedy</i>&nbsp;embraces this concept; see&nbsp;<i>Par</i>. XXXIII, 133 ff.</p>
<p><a name="N_42_"></a>42.&nbsp;<i>the 12 signs</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The signs of the Zodiac.</p>
<p><a name="N_43_"></a>43.&nbsp;<i>it results from our negligence</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reference is to the&nbsp;<i>Quadripartitus</i>&nbsp;I,
 1, 2. It is likely that “negligence” signifies indolence. Dante uses 
the same root word to describe Belacqua’s moral condition (<i>Purg</i>. IV, 110-111).</p>
<p><a name="N_44_"></a>44.&nbsp;<i>the Starry Heaven</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The heaven of the Fixed Stars. The Arctic Pole is considered visible 
because the human race lives in the northern hemisphere, but the 
Antarctic Pole, the site of Mt. Purgatory, was thought visible only from
 the southern and uninhabited hemisphere (see&nbsp;<i>Inf</i>. XXVI, 127
 ff). The revolution of the Fixed Stars on its axis from east to west 
took place every twenty-four hours, but a second, virtually invisible 
motion (“almost hidden from us”), along the equinoctial circle, occurred
 in the opposite direction at the rate of one degree every one hundred 
years.</p>
<p><a name="N_45_"></a>45.&nbsp;<i>the fifth book of the first group of books</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aristotle’s works used to place the group of books entitled&nbsp;<i>Octo libri Physicorum</i>, more generally known as the&nbsp;<i>Physica</i>, at the beginning of his published works on science.</p>
<p><a name="N_46_"></a>46.&nbsp;<i>the fable of Phaëton</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Metamorphoses</i>&nbsp;II, 35 ff.</p>
<p><a name="N_47_"></a>47.&nbsp;<i>in the New Translation . . .</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new translation carried St. Thomas’ commentary, the old that of Albert the Great.</p>
<p><a name="N_48_"></a>48.&nbsp;<i>the second book of the Ethics</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Thomas’ commentary on the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>&nbsp;II, 1, 245.</p>
<p><a name="N_49_"></a>49.&nbsp;<i>in the fifth book of the Ethics</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not in Aristotle’s work, but in a commentary on the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>&nbsp;by Averroes (I, 2).</p>
<p><a name="N_50_"></a>50.&nbsp;<i>Christ says of this science</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John 14:27.</p>
<p><a name="N_51_"></a>51.&nbsp;<i>Solomon, speaking of this science</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Song of Solomon 6:8-9.</p>
<p><a name="N_52_"></a>52.&nbsp;<i>the fictive and literal exposition</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fictive level&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>the literal level of meaning.</p>
<p><a name="N_53_"></a>53.&nbsp;<i>as the first course</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 With this last reference to the canzoni as courses of meat and the 
ensuing commentaries as bread, Dante abandons his metaphor of the 
banquet.</p>
