    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        As Aristotle states at the commencement of his <em>Metaphysics</em>,
 all men by nature desire to know. The reason for this is that 
everything, impelled by the force of its own nature, inclines towards 
perfection of itself; therefore, since knowledge is the ultimate 
perfection of our spirit, in which our ultimate happiness lies, we are 
all by nature bound to desire it. However, many are deprived of this 
most noble of perfections for various reasons lying within man, and 
outside him, which prevent him from forming the habit of seeking 
knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within man there exist two defects and impediments: one 
appertaining to the body, the other to the spirit. The defect of body 
occurs when its parts do not function correctly, so that it cannot 
receive anything, as with the deaf, the dumb, and such like. That of the
 spirit occurs when evil conquers it, so that it follows vicious 
pleasures, by which it is so deceived that through it everything becomes
 vile. Similarly two causes outside of man can be identified, one of 
which condemns him to duty, the other to idleness. The first is domestic
 and civic responsibility, which properly engages most men, so that they
 have no time for contemplation. The other is the defect arising from 
the location where someone is born and raised, which often not only 
lacks all places of learning, but is distant from educated people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two of these defects, the first within man and the first outside
 him, are not a reason for criticism, but are deserving of excuse and 
pardon; the other two merit our censure and scorn, though one more than 
the other. Anyone who reflects deeply can plainly see that there are few
 who can attain to that habit of knowledge desired by all, while those 
who live deprived forever of this nourishment are innumerable. Oh, 
blessed are the few who sit at that table where the bread of angels is 
eaten! And wretched are those who must graze along with the sheep!
    </p>
    <p>
        But since every man is by nature a friend towards every other, 
and every friend is grieved by a defect in one he loves, those who are 
fed at so noble a table are not without pity for those they see grazing 
on grass and acorns where the animals pasture. And since pity is the 
mother of generosity, those who have knowledge always give freely of 
their great riches to the truly impoverished, and are like a living 
fountain with whose waters the natural thirst referred to above is 
quenched. So I who do not sit at the table of the blessed, I who have 
fled the common pasture, and merely gather a part of what falls at the 
feet of those who do sit there, and know the wretched life of those I 
have left behind by the sweetness I taste in what I gather piecemeal, 
and am moved by compassion for all, including myself, I then have 
reserved for the wretched those poems which I set before their eyes a 
while ago to stimulate their desire.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wishing to lay the table, I intend to present a communal banquet
 of what I showed them, with the bread of commentary that must accompany
 such poetic meat, and without which it could not be eaten. And this 
banquet, deserving of such bread, offers meat which I do not intend to 
serve in vain. And therefore I’d have none there whose organs are badly 
served because they lack teeth, tongue or palate; nor any addicted to 
vice, with stomachs so full of poisonous and unbalanced humours that 
they would be unable to retain my meat. But come all whose hunger arises
 from domestic or civic duty, and sit at the table with those similarly 
affected; and let all those sit at their feet who are not worthy through
 idleness of a higher place; and let both eat of my meat and bread, for I
 wish them to both taste and digest it. The meat at this banquet will be
 prepared in fourteen ways, in fourteen <em>canzoni</em> that is of love
 and virtue, which lacking bread were to some degree obscure, so that 
for many their beauty pleased more than their goodness. But the bread, 
that is, the present explanation, will be a light to make visible ever 
shade of their meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the matter is treated more maturely, as I wish, in this work, the <em>Convivio</em>, than it was in the <em>Vita Nuova</em>,
 I do not wish to disparage the latter in any way, but to give it 
greater support by this work; seeing that it was appropriate for it to 
be ardent and passionate, and for this to be mature and temperate. It is
 right to speak and act differently according to one’s age, since 
certain manners are laudable and fitting at one age that are blameworthy
 and inappropriate at another, as I will show later in the fourth book. I
 wrote the former work at the threshold of youth, and this when I had 
passed beyond it. And since aspects of my true meaning were other than 
that which the canzoni I mentioned show, I intend to reveal them by 
allegorical exposition, after giving a literal account; so that both may
 be savoured by those invited to this feast. I ask all for whom this 
banquet fails to match the splendour of their desire, to attribute every
 defect to my capability and not to my will; since it is my wish to be 
wholly and lovingly generous.
    </p>
    <p class="line-break"></p>
    <h3 class="text-center">
        <span id="anchor_Toc189547282">Chapter II: Speaking about Oneself</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        At the commencement of every well-run banquet the servants 
normally take the bread set out, and cleanse it of any impurity. So I, 
who play their role in the present work, intend first of all to remove 
two impurities from this exposition, which forms the bread I am serving.
 The first is that to speak of oneself seems impermissible; the second 
that to expound things in too much depth seems unreasonable; and the 
knife of my argument must remove both the impermissible and the 
unreasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rhetoricians forbid anyone to speak of themselves except of 
necessity, and the reason for this restriction is that one cannot avoid 
praising or criticizing the person about whom one speaks, and such 
things are coarse, when spoken of self, on anyone’s lips. And to dispel a
 doubt that arises here, I say it is worse to criticize than to praise, 
though neither should be indulged. The reason is that anything 
blameworthy in itself is worse than something which is so only by 
accident. To disparage oneself is blameworthy in itself, since one 
should tell a friend of his faults in private, and no one is a greater 
friend than a man is to himself; so that one should reprimand oneself 
and sorrow over one’s defects in the chamber of one’s own thought, and 
not publicly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, a person is not usually blamed for being unable or 
ignorant of how to behave properly, but always for being unwilling to do
 so, because good and evil are judged by our willingness or 
unwillingness; therefore he who criticizes himself shows that he 
endorses his faults, endorses his lack of virtue: thus criticizing 
oneself is, of itself, to be rejected. Praising oneself is to be avoided
 only as an accidental ill, since one cannot praise oneself without it 
being mostly blame. It is surface praise, but blame to him who looks 
beneath: for words are made to reveal what is unknown; and he who 
praises himself shows that he does not think himself valued, which 
implies a bad conscience, which he discloses in praising himself, and by
 disclosing it criticizes himself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, self-praise and self-criticism are to be avoided for the 
same reason as giving false testimony; since no one can truly take their
 own measure truly and justly, so greatly does self-love deceive. 
Everyone measures themselves like a dishonest trader who buys with one 
measure and sells with another; since everyone uses a large measure for 
his bad deeds, and a short measure for his good ones, so that number, 
weight and size of the good seem greater than if a true measure was 
used, and lesser in the case of the bad. So, in speaking of oneself, 
with praise or its opposite, one either speaks falsely concerning the 
matter one talks of, or falsely regarding its importance, which covers 
both cases. And then, since silence signifies consent, he who praises or
 blames someone to their face acts discourteously, since the person 
addressed can neither agree or disagree without falling into the error 
of self-blame or self-praise: except when punishment is merited, and it 
cannot be exercised without reproving the error to be corrected, or when
 honour and praise are deserved, and they cannot be given without 
mention of virtuous deeds and honours virtuously won.
    </p>
    <p>
        To return, however, to the main topic, I say that, as touched on
 above, speaking of oneself, of necessity, is allowed: and among the 
cases of necessity two are obvious. One is when great infamy or danger 
cannot be avoided except by doing so; and then nit is permitted, because
 to follow the lesser of two evils is equivalent to following the good. 
This necessity is what moved Boethius to speak of himself, so that under
 the guise of his <em>Consolation</em> he could defend himself against 
the endless infamy of his exile, and show it to be unjust, since no 
other defender presented himself. The other is when, by speaking of 
oneself, great benefit accrues to another by way of education; and this 
is what moved Augustine in his <em>Confessions</em> to speak of himself,
 because through the progress of his life from bad to good, good to 
better, and better to best, he provided an example and instruction which
 only true testimony such as his could give.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, if these two reasons provide a justification, the bread 
from my wheat is sufficiently cleansed of the first impurity. Fear of 
discredit moves me, and a desire moves me to give that instruction which
 others truly cannot give. I fear discredit for having yielded to the 
great passion, which anyone who reads the canzoni mentioned above will 
see as having once ruled me; which infamy will cease utterly if I speak 
of myself and show that the driving force was not passion but virtue. I 
intend to show also the true meaning of the canzoni, which none will see
 if I do not reveal it, because it is hidden beneath a veil of allegory:
 and doing so will not only bring delight to the ear, but useful 
instruction concerning this mode of speech and the understanding of 
similar works.
    </p>
    <p class="line-break"></p>
    <h3 class="text-center">
        <span id="anchor_Toc189547283">Chapter III: Detailed Exposition: Fame’s Effect</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        That action is deserving of severe censure which introduces the 
defect it seeks to remove; as if one sent to end a quarrel begins 
another before doing so. And now my bread has been cleansed on one side,
 I must cleanse it on the other to escape such censure, since this 
writing, which can almost be called a commentary, is intended to 
eliminate the defect of obscurity in the canzoni mentioned above, and 
this may prove in part somewhat difficult. The difficulties are 
intentional in order to avoid a greater defect, and are not due to lack 
of thought. Ah, if only it had pleased the Maker of the Universe for the
 cause of my apology never to have existed! Since others would not have 
sinned against me and I would not have suffered an unjust punishment: 
that of exile and poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since it pleased the citizens of Florence, the most beautiful 
and famous daughter of Rome, to cast me from her sweet bosom – where I 
was born and nurtured to maturity, and where, with her goodwill, and 
with all my heart, I desire to rest my weary mind, and end the span of 
life given to me – I have wandered, like a beggar almost, through 
virtually all the regions where our language holds sway, displaying 
against my will the wounds of fate, for which the wounded man is often 
unjustly held accountable. Truly, I have been a ship without sail and 
without rudder, carried to various harbours, bays and shores by the dry 
wind of grievous poverty; and I have been seen by many who perhaps 
because of some report imagined me as other than I am, such that not 
only was my person held in low esteem, but all my works were valued 
less, those done as well as those yet to come. The reason why this 
happens – not just to me, but to everyone – I wish to touch on briefly: 
it is firstly because fame alters things with respect to their truth; 
and then because proximity diminishes them in the same respect.
    </p>
    <p>
        A fine reputation is principally created by fine thoughts in the
 mind of a friend, and is first born from them; for the mind of one 
inimical, though it receives the seed, does not conceive. The mind which
 first gives it birth, to make its gift fairer, and out of love for the 
friend who will receive it, does not keep within the confines of truth, 
but goes beyond them. When the mind exceeds them so as to embellish what
 it says, it acts against conscience; when it exceeds them in an error 
arising from love, it does not act so. A second mind, receiving what has
 been said, is not content merely with the excesses of the first, but 
seeks to embellish it in report, as if it were of its own making; and so
 much so that through this action and the error born of love, it swells a
 reputation beyond what it first was, like the first mind, whether in 
accord or discordant with conscience. A third mind receiving it does the
 same, and a fourth, and so it is endlessly inflated. And so, by taking 
the opposite motive to that mentioned above, one sees the cause of poor 
reputation, which is distorted in the same manner. Thus Virgil says, in 
the fourth book of the <em>Aeneid</em>, that Fame thrives on movement 
and gains by circulation. Anyone can clearly see that the image formed 
by fame is always greater, no matter what kind of fame it is, than the 
true state of the thing imagined.
    </p>
    <p class="line-break"></p>
    <h3 class="text-center">
        <span id="anchor_Toc189547284">Chapter IV: Detailed Exposition: Proximity’s Effect</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        Having shown the reason why fame extends good and evil beyond 
their true dimensions, it remains for this chapter to present reasons to
 show why proximity by contrast diminishes them; and having shown them, 
to move swiftly to the back to the main topic, that is, my excuse for 
the defect mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three reasons why a person’s presence makes him seem 
less worthy than he truly is: the first of these is immaturity, not of 
age but of mind; the second is envy – and these two reside in the one 
making the judgement – the third is human imperfection, and this is an 
attribute of the one being judged.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first, immaturity, can be discussed briefly as follows. The 
majority of men live through the senses, like children, and not 
according to reason; as such they understand things only simply, by 
their exterior, and the goodness within things, which is ordained to a 
proper end, they do not see, because the eye of reason is closed which 
penetrates to sight of it. Thus they quickly see all that they can, and 
judge according to their sight. And since they only form their opinion 
of another’s fame by hearsay, which opinion clashes, in that person’s 
presence, with their imperfect judgement, since it judges by the senses 
only and not by reason, they regard what they have previously heard as a
 lie and disparage the person they previously valued. So for these 
people, who, alas, comprise almost all humanity, proximity diminishes 
every quality. Such people are quickly charmed and quickly sated, are 
often happy or sad in brief delight or sorrow, quick to make friends, 
and quick to become enemies; doing everything like children, without the
 aid of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second, envy, can be dealt with in this way: that in the 
vicious apparent equality causes envy, and envy is a cause of poor 
judgement, because it prevents reason from arguing on behalf of whoever 
is envied, and the power of judgement is then like a judge who only 
hears one side. So when people like these meet a famous person, they are
 immediately envious, because they see similar limbs and faculties to 
their own, and fear, because of the excellence of that person, that they
 will be less valued. And not only do those filled with passion judge 
badly but, by denigrating those they judge, cause others to judge badly 
too; so for these people proximity diminishes the good and bad in 
everyone presented to them; and I say bad, because many people, 
delighting in bad deeds, are envious of wrongdoers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third is human imperfection, which applies to the person who
 is judged, and is not apparent without some familiarity and intimacy 
with him. As evidence of this, we know that humanity is imperfect in 
many respects, and, as Augustine says, no one is without imperfection. 
Sometimes a man is marked by a passion he cannot withstand; sometimes by
 some physical deformity; sometimes by a stroke of misfortune; and 
sometimes by the notoriety of his parents or someone close to him. Fame 
does not carry these things about with it, but proximity does, revealing
 them by intimacy. And these blemishes cast a shadow on the brightness 
of virtue, so that they make it seem duller and less worthy, That is the
 reason every prophet is honoured less in his own country; that is the 
reason why a virtuous man should allow few into his presence, and be 
intimate with still fewer, so that his name is known, but not devalued. 
This third cause applies to evil as well as good, if each stage in the 
argument addresses that opposite. So it is clearly seen, that through 
imperfection, which no one is free of, proximity diminishes the good and
 bad in everyone more than truth warrants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, as I said above, I have met nearly everyone of note in 
Italy, so that I have made myself appear less than the truth warrants, 
not only to those who were already aware of my fame, but others also, so
 that doubtless my works as well as my person are made light of. 
Therefore it is appropriate for me to add weight to this present work, 
by means of a nobler style, so that it may evidence greater authority. 
And this should be enough to excuse the difficulties of my commentary.

    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        Now the bread is cleared of its accidental impurities, it 
remains to excuse one of substance; that is, its being in the vernacular
 and not in Latin; speaking metaphorically, that it is made of oats and 
not of the finest wheat. Briefly it is excusable for three reasons, 
which led me to choose the one language rather than the other: the first
 arises from caution, in not creating an inappropriate relationship; the
 second from zealous generosity; and the third from natural love of the 
native tongue. And I intend to comment on these three points 
individually and in turn, so as to counter any objection made on the 
above basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        What most adorn and commend human action, and lead it to a good 
end by the most direct route, are habitual traits of character directed 
to the intended end, as, for example, boldness of mind and strength of 
body directed towards chivalry. And thus anyone who is set to serve 
another must have traits directed to that end, such as submissiveness, 
understanding and obedience, without which a man is not equipped to 
serve well. For if he is not submissive in all his functions, he will 
always carry out his service with effort and strain and will rarely 
persist in it; and if he fails to understand his master’s needs and is 
not obedient, he will serve only in accord with his own will and 
judgement, which is to serve rather as a friend than as a servant. So, 
to avoid an inappropriate relationship, it is right that this 
commentary, which plays the role of a servant to the <em>canzoni</em> which follow later, should be subject to them in all its functions and recognise the needs of its superiors and obey them.
    </p>
    <p>
        These traits would be lacking if it were in Latin and not the vernacular, since the <em>canzoni</em>
 are in the vernacular. In the first place it would not have been 
subject to them but sovereign over them, due to its nobility, virtue and
 beauty. Nobility: because Latin is everlasting and incorruptible, while
 the vernacular is unstable and corruptible. Thus in the ancient Latin 
tragedies and comedies, which cannot alter, we find the same Latin as we
 have now; this is not the case with the vernacular, which, fashioned to
 our liking, undergoes change. So, in the last fifty years, in the 
cities of Italy, if we care to look closely, many words have become 
obsolete, been created, or been altered; if such a short time can alter 
things, what can a longer time not do. Thus I say that if those who 
departed this life a thousand years ago were to visit their city again, 
they would consider it under foreign occupation, the language would be 
so different from their own. This will be discussed elsewhere in a book I
 intend to write on <em>Eloquence in the Vernacular</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, Latin would have been not subject but sovereign because of
 its virtue. All is virtuous in nature which fulfils the purpose towards
 which it is directed; and the better it does this the more virtuous it 
is. So we call a man virtuous who lives the contemplative or active life
 to which he is naturally ordained; we say a horse has virtue which runs
 fast and far, and is constituted so to do; and we say a sword has 
virtue which is so constituted as to cut through hard objects easily. 
Thus language, which is constituted so as to express human thought, has 
virtue when it does this, and the more completely it does so the more 
virtue it possesses; therefore, since Latin expresses many things that 
the mind conceives while the vernacular cannot, as those conversant in 
both languages know, its virtue is greater than that of the vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
        And then, Latin would have been not subject but sovereign 
because of its beauty. Men call a thing beautiful when its parts 
correspond fittingly, since their harmony results in beauty. So a man 
appears beautiful when his limbs are in proportion; and we call a song 
beautiful when its voices harmonise according to the rules of art. And 
it follows that the most beautiful language is that in which the words 
agree most perfectly; and they agree more perfectly in Latin than in the
 vernacular, because while the vernacular is established through usage, 
Latin follows art; consequently we deem Latin more beautiful, more 
virtuous and nobler. This concludes my main point: that is, that Latin 
would have been not subject to my <em>canzoni</em> but sovereign over them.

        <span id="anchor_Toc189547286">Chapter VI: The Vernacular: Understanding</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        Having shown how the present commentary would not have been subject to the vernacular <em>canzoni</em>
 if it had been in Latin, it remains to show how it would not have 
comprehended them nor have been responsive to them; so that we can reach
 conclusion that it was essential to use the vernacular to avoid 
creating an inappropriate relationship. I say that Latin would not have 
served a vernacular master with comprehension for the following reason. 
The servant is required to comprehend two things perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first is the nature of his master. Now there are masters of 
so stupid a nature that they request the opposite of what they desire, 
and others who expect to be understood without uttering a word, and 
others who do not wish the servant to act as necessary unless ordered to
 so. I don’t intent to explain now why there are these differences among
 men (as it would form too long a digression) except to say that in 
general such men are like the beasts, who gain little from use of 
reason. If the servant does not understand his master’s nature, it is 
clear that he cannot serve him effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second is that the servant must understand his master’s 
friends, since otherwise he could not honour or serve them, and in 
consequence could not serve his master perfectly; for friends are like 
parts of the whole, since wholeness consists in willing as one and not 
willing as one.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Latin commentary could not have comprehended those things 
which the vernacular does. That Latin does not understand the vernacular
 and its allies is demonstrated as follows. He who knows something in 
general does not know it perfectly, just as someone who identifies a 
creature from a distance recognises it imperfectly since he does not 
know if it is dog, wolf, or goat. Latin comprehends the vernacular in 
general, but not in particular, for if it understood it in particular it
 would recognise each of the vernaculars, having no reason to recognise 
one more than another. Thus anyone having perfect knowledge of Latin 
would be able to understand any particular vernacular. But this is not 
the case, since a person with perfect knowledge of Latin cannot thereby 
distinguish, if he is from Italy, the English vernacular from the 
German; nor if he is a German, the Italian vernacular from the 
Provençal. Thus it is clear that Latin does not comprehend the 
vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore it does not comprehend its allies, since it is 
impossible to understand someone’s friends without understanding that 
person; thus, if Latin does not comprehend the vernacular, as shown 
above, it cannot know its allies. And then, without familiarity and 
intimacy it is impossible to know people, and Latin is employed less 
between people in any one country than is the vernacular, with which all
 are allied; consequently it cannot comprehend all the friends of that 
vernacular. There is no contradiction in stating, as one might, that 
Latin nevertheless is allied with certain friends of the vernacular; 
since, that still does not give it familiarity with all of them, and so 
its friends are not comprehended perfectly, and it is perfect and not 
defective knowledge that we require.
    </p>
    <p class="line-break"></p>
    <h3 class="text-center">
        <span id="anchor_Toc189547287">Chapter VII: The Vernacular: Obedience</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        Having demonstrated why a Latin commentary would not have been 
an understanding servant, I will say why it would not have shown 
obedience. He is obedient who possesses that favourable disposition 
which is called obedience. True obedience requires three things without 
which it cannot exist: it should show sweetness, and not bitterness; 
should be wholly subservient and not wilful; and should be measured and 
not beyond measure. These three things a Latin commentary could not have
 possessed, and therefore it could not show obedience. That this would 
have been impossible for Latin, as has been said, is clarified by the 
following argument.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything that progresses inversely is disagreeable, and 
consequently tastes bitter and not sweet, such as to sleep during the 
day and lie awake all night, or to walk backwards and not forwards. For 
the subject to command the sovereign is to progress inversely (since the
 correct process is for the sovereign to command the servant); thus it 
tastes bitter and not sweet. And since it is impossible to obey a bitter
 command sweetly, it is impossible for the sovereign to obey sweetly if 
the subject commands. Thus, if Latin is sovereign over the vernacular, 
as has been shown variously above, and yet the <em>canzoni</em> which play the commanding role are in the vernacular, it is impossible for Latin to show sweet obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then obedience is entirely subservient and in now way wilful 
when the person obeying would not have acted without being commanded to 
do so, wholly or in part. Thus if I am ordered to don two robes, and 
wear only one without being so commanded, I would say that my response 
is not wholly the result of being commanded but partly wilful. Such 
would the response of a Latin commentary have been, and consequently it 
would not have been wholly the result of being commanded. That such 
would have been the case is apparent from this: that without being so 
directed by its master, Latin would have exposed many alternative 
meanings – and it does so, as he who carefully examines works in Latin 
knows – which the vernacular in no way contained.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, obedience is measured and not beyond measure when it acts 
within the bounds of what is commanded and not beyond them, just as 
individual nature obeys universal nature when it endows a man with 
thirty-two teeth, neither more nor less; and man obeys the nature of 
justice when he makes a wrongdoer pay his debt to society, to the 
degree, neither more nor less, that justice demands. Latin would not 
have done this, and would have sinned not only through deficiency or 
excess, but through both; and so its obedience would not have been 
measured, but beyond measure, and consequently it would not have been 
perfectly obedient.
    </p>
    <p>
        That Latin would not have fulfilled its master’s command, and 
would have exceeded it is easily shown. The masters that is the <em>canzoni</em>
 to which this commentary plays the role of servant, command and desire 
that their meaning be explained to all who can comprehend it, so that 
when their words are heard they will be understood. And there is no 
doubt that if they made their command heard, this is what it would be. 
Latin though would not have explained them except to the learned, since 
no one else would have understood. Therefore, since the unlearned are 
far more numerous than the learned among those who desire to understand 
them, it follows that Latin would not have fulfilled their desire as 
well as the vernacular, which is understood by the learned and unlearned
 alike.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, Latin would have explained them to people of other 
countries, such as the Germans, English and others, and here it would 
have exceeded what was commanded; for it would have been wilful 
(speaking broadly) for their meaning to be explained when their beauty 
could not be conveyed with it. Thus all should know that nothing 
harmonised according to the rules of poetry can be translated from its 
native tongue into another without destroying its original sweetness and
 harmony. That is the reason why Homer has not now been translated from 
Greek into Latin as other Greek writings have. And this is the reason 
why the verses of the Psalter lack sweetness of music and harmony; for 
they were translated from Hebrew into Greek, and from Greek into Latin, 
and in the first translation all their sweetness was lost. Thus I have 
dealt fully with what was promised in the preceding chapter.

        <span id="anchor_Toc189547288">Chapter VIII: The Vernacular: Generosity</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        Now it has been sufficiently demonstrated that, in explaining the <em>canzoni</em>
 mentioned above, a commentary in the vernacular and not in Latin was 
necessary to avoid an inappropriate relationship, I intend to show also 
how perfect generosity made me choose the former and forego the latter. 
Now perfect generosity may be noted in three characteristics of the 
vernacular which would not have been consequential on the use of Latin. 
The first is that of giving to many people; the second is that of giving
 things of use; the third is that of giving without being asked.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give to and assist one person is good, but perfect goodness 
is to give to and assist many in that this resembles the beneficence of 
God, who is the universal benefactor. Then, to give to many people 
without helping individuals is impossible, since the individual is 
included in the many, though it is quite possible to give to one without
 giving to the many. Thus he who helps many acts well in both ways; he 
who helps one person does good in only that case; hence we see that 
lawmakers keep their eyes fixed on the common good in the main when 
making law. Then, to give things that are not of use to the recipient is
 good, in that he who gives at least shows that he is a friend; but it 
is not perfectly good, and so is not complete, as, for example, a knight
 were to give a doctor a shield, or a doctor to give the knight a copy 
of Hippocrates’ <em>Aphorisms</em> or Galen’s <em>Art</em>. Thus the 
wise say that the nature of a gift should reflect the nature of the 
recipient, that is to say, it should be appropriate and useful to him; 
and in this way the generosity of one discerning in his gifts is said to
 be complete. But since a discussion of moral concepts usually creates a
 desire to understand their rationale, I intend to indicate briefly, in 
this chapter, four reasons why a gift should be useful to the person who
 receives it in order for it to display complete generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, virtue should be joyful and not sorrowful in it 
actions: so that, if the gift is not joyous in the giving and in the 
receiving, its virtue is neither complete nor perfect. This joyousness 
is given only by usefulness, which accrues to the giver through giving, 
and which is transferred to the receiver in receiving. The giver, 
therefore, must have the foresight to act so that on his side lies the 
usefulness of integrity, which is above all usefulness, and so that the 
usefulness of the thing given passes to the recipient; in this way both 
will be joyful, and thus generosity will be the more complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, virtue must always work towards the better: for, just 
as it would be reprehensible to turn a good sword into a spade, or a 
beautiful lute into a decent bowl, so it is reprehensible to transfer 
something from a place where it is useful to one where it will be less 
so. And just as it is reprehensible to work in vain, it is reprehensible
 to place it where it is equally useful, not merely where it is less 
useful. So, for a change of place to be praiseworthy, it must always be 
for the better, because it should aim to be in the highest degree 
praiseworthy, and it cannot be so unless the gift increases its value 
through its transfer, and it cannot increase its value unless it is more
 useful to the recipient than the giver. From this we conclude that the 
gift must be useful to the person who receives it, if the giving is to 
display complete generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thirdly, the exercise of virtue should of itself aim to acquire 
friends, since our life requires them and the end of virtue is to make 
ourselves content. For a gift to stimulate friendship in the recipient, 
it must be useful to him, since usefulness stamps the gift’s image in 
his memory, which nurtures friendship, and does so the more strongly the
 greater the usefulness is. So the scholar says: ‘The gift he gave me 
will never fade from my mind.’ Thus, for the gift to have virtue, and 
display generosity, and for it to be complete, it must be useful to the 
person receiving it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, virtue must be exercised freely and not under 
compulsion. Action is free when a person moves in a certain direction 
willingly, evidenced by his turning his gaze in that direction; while 
action is exercised under compulsion when a man acts against his will, 
shown by his not gazing in the direction where he is going. Now a gift 
directed towards the needs of the recipient is turned in his direction. 
Since it cannot be so directed if it is not useful, it must be the case 
that in order for it to be transferred freely, virtue must accompany the
 gift as it is moves in that direction, which is towards the recipient: 
thus the gift must be useful to the recipient in order for it to reveal 
complete generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third trait, mentioned at the start of this chapter, which 
reveals complete generosity, is giving without being asked; because what
 is requested is a subject of commerce not of virtue, since the 
recipient buys even though the giver does not offer for sale. That is 
why Seneca says in <em>De Beneficiis</em> that: ‘Nothing is so dearly 
purchased as that which is paid for with prayers.’ In order for a gift 
to manifest complete generosity, it must be free from every taint of 
commerce: the gift must be unasked. Why what is prayed for costs so 
dearly, I do not intend to discuss here, since it will be discussed 
adequately in the final book of this work.

    <h3 class="text-center">
        <span id="anchor_Toc189547289">Chapter IX: The Vernacular: Generosity Displayed</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        Latin would have failed to meet all of the three conditions 
mentioned above, all of which must be met for a gift to display complete
 generosity, and this can be clearly shown, as follows. Latin would not 
have served many, for, recalling what was previously said, the learned 
to whom the Italian language is foreign, being unable to read the <em>canzoni</em>,
 would not have availed themselves of this service; while if we consider
 those who are natives of the Italian language, we will find that not 
one in a thousand would indeed have been served in any rational manner, 
because they would not have accepted this gift, being deprived of all 
nobility of mind, which desires this food above all, by their proneness 
to avarice. I say that, to their shame, they should not be considered 
learned, since they do not acquire learning for its own sake but only in
 order to gain wealth or honour; just as we should not consider someone a
 lute player who keeps a lute in his house in order to rent it out, 
rather than play it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Returning to the main proposition, I say it may clearly be seen 
that Latin would have benefited few, while the vernacular will be of 
service to many. For goodness of mind, which this work addresses, is 
found in those who, because of the sinful world’s neglect of good, have 
abandoned literature to those who have turned her from a lady to a 
whore; and these noble persons comprise princes, barons, and knights as 
well as many others, women as well as men, who know only the vernacular 
of this language, and are not learned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, Latin would not have been the giver of a useful gift as 
the vernacular is, since nothing is useful unless it is used, nor does 
goodness lie in its potential, which is not a perfected state of being, 
just as with gold, pearls or other treasure that lie buried; and what is
 in the hands of avarice is buried deeper than hidden treasure. This 
commentary’s true gift is the meaning of the <em>canzoni</em> for which 
it was made, a meaning which is intended to lead men to knowledge and 
virtue, above all, as will be seen in the full course of their analysis.
 This meaning can only be of use to those in whom true nobility is 
seeded, in the manner that will be described in the fourth book; and 
virtually all these people only know the vernacular, like the noble men 
and women I referred to above. Even if there are some learned ones among
 them, there is no contradiction; for as my master Aristotle says in the
 first book of the <em>Ethics</em>: ‘One swallow doesn’t make a summer.’
 It is thus evident that the vernacular offers something useful which 
Latin would not have provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, the vernacular gives the gift without being asked, which 
Latin would not, because it offers a commentary, which none have asked 
for; while this cannot be said of Latin, which is often requested to 
provide a commentary and a gloss on many writings, as can readily be 
seen in the preface to many of them. And so it is clear that I was moved
 to employ the vernacular rather than Latin by complete generosity.

        <span id="anchor_Toc189547290">Chapter X: The Vernacular: Love of the Native Tongue</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        At a banquet so noble in its fare, and so distinguished by its 
guests, a full apology is necessary for serving bread made of oats and 
not wheat; and the reason for departing from what has long been 
established practice, namely the use of Latin in commentaries, should be
 made evident. The reason should be made clear thus because the fate of 
new things is uncertain, since the experience is lacking though which 
things long observed and in use are measured, as to the progress they 
represent and their aim. That is why the Digest of Roman Law was moved 
to command that a man should enter a new path with care, since: ‘when 
establishing something new the reason for departing from established 
custom should be made evident.’
    </p>
    <p>
        So, no one should be surprised if the digression I have made, in
 order to present my apology, proves lengthy; and since it is necessary 
let them suffer its length patiently. Pursuing my apology further, now 
that I have shown how I was moved to employ the vernacular and not Latin
 firstly in order to avoid an inappropriate relationship, and secondly 
for reasons of complete generosity, I now need to show, thirdly and 
lastly, how I was moved to do so through innate love of my native 
tongue. I say that innate love moves the lover to do three things above 
all: firstly to enhance the beloved object; secondly to be solicitous on
 its behalf; and thirdly to defend it, which happens continually as 
anyone can observe. These three motives made me adopt the vernacular, 
which I love and have loved both innately and contingently. I was moved 
firstly to enhance it, and the way in which I do so can be seen by the 
following argument.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now things can be enhanced, that is made greater, by many kinds 
of greatness, and nothing makes them as great as through their own 
goodness, which is the mother and preserver of all other kinds of 
greatness, for man can possess no vaster greatness than that of virtuous
 action, which is his own proper excellence, by means of which the 
greatnesses of true dignity, true honour, true power, true wealth, true 
friends, and true and glorious fame are acquired and preserved; and this
 greatness I endow this friend, the vernacular, with, since what it 
possesses of latent and potential goodness I make it express, actively 
and openly by means of its own proper activity, which is to make 
manifest the meaning conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, I was moved by solicitousness on its behalf. 
Solicitousness on a friend’s behalf makes a man anxious to provide for 
future events. Thinking that the desire to comprehend the <em>canzoni</em>
 might induce some unlearned person to initiate a translation of a Latin
 commentary into the vernacular, and fearing that the translation might 
have been carried out by someone who would have made the vernacular 
appear crude, as did Thaddeus the Hippocratist who translated 
Aristotle’s <em>Nichomachean Ethics</em> from the Latin, I decided to carry it out myself, trusting my own skill more than another’s.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was moved also to defend the Italian vernacular from its 
numerous detractors who disparage it, while commending other 
vernaculars, especially the language of <em>oc</em>, calling it better 
and more beautiful than this one, and thereby deviating from the truth. 
For by means of this commentary the great goodness of the language of <em>sì</em>
 will be evident, because its virtue will be displayed, namely how it 
expresses the noblest and freshest concepts almost as fittingly, fully 
and gracefully as Latin. This virtue could not be displayed as 
effectively in verse, since verse has the contingent adornments of rhyme
 and metre bound to it, just as a woman’s beauty cannot be effectively 
displayed when her adornments of dress and cosmetics do more to make her
 admired than she herself. Thus, if one wishes rightly to assess a 
woman’s beauty, look at her when her natural beauty alone attends her, 
unaccompanied by any contingencies of adornment; and likewise with this 
commentary, in which the flow of its syllables, the appropriateness of 
its construction, and the smoothness of its oration will be noted, such 
that whoever studies it deeply will find it to be filled with the 
sweetest and most exquisite beauty. But since the best way to reveal the
 defects and malice of an accuser is to probe his intentions, I will 
explain why they are moved to disparage the Italian language, so as to 
confound them, and I will now write a separate chapter on this matter, 
so that their infamy can be rendered even more obvious.

        <span id="anchor_Toc189547291">Chapter XI: The Vernacular: Its Detractors</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        I say that the motive which leads these contemptible men of 
Italy to praise the vernacular of others, and disparage their own, to 
their perpetual shame and humiliation arises from five vile causes. The 
first is blindness in discernment; the second the making of disingenuous
 excuses; the third, desire for glory; the fourth reasoning rooted in 
envy; and the fifth and last, baseness of mind, that is pusillanimity. 
Each of these faults is committed so widely that few are free of them 
all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of the first we may argue as follows. Just as the sensory part 
of the mind has a faculty of sight, by means of which it apprehends the 
difference between things with respect to their external colour, so the 
rational part has a faculty by which it apprehends the difference 
between things with respect to how they are directed to some aim: and 
this is discernment. And just as he whose eyes are blind always follows 
where others lead him for good or ill, so he who is blind to the light 
of discernment always follows the popular cry in his judgement, whether 
true or false. So whenever the one who cries out is blind, he and the 
others who depend on him, being likewise blind, must come to a sad end. 
That is why it is said that: ‘if the blind lead the blind both shall 
fall into the ditch.’
    </p>
    <p>
        This popular cry has long been directed against the vernacular, 
for reasons which will be discussed further below. And so the blind, 
mentioned above, almost infinite in number, their hands placed on the 
shoulders of these deceivers, have fallen into the ditch of false 
opinion from which they are unable to escape. The common populace 
especially lack the use of this light of discernment because, occupied 
with some trade or other from their youth, they direct their minds to it
 by force of necessity, so that they are concerned with little else. 
Since virtuous habits, whether moral or intellectual, cannot be acquired
 suddenly but must be gained through practice, and since their practice 
is devoted to some craft, and they do not trouble themselves by 
perceiving other things, it is impossible for them to possess 
discernment. As a result they often follow the cries of, ‘Long live 
their name!’ and ‘Death to their memory!’ if someone but begins them. 
This is the most dangerous aspect of their blindness. Thus Boethius in 
the <em>Consolation</em> judges popular approval to be idle, because he 
sees that it lacks discernment. These people are to be called sheep and 
not men, since if a sheep throws itself from a thousand-foot high cliff,
 all the flock will follow; and if one sheep leaps while crossing a road
 for some reason, the rest will leap too though there is nothing there 
to leap over. I have seen many vanish into a well after one leapt in, 
thinking perhaps that they were leaping a wall, even though the 
shepherd, weeping and shouting, tried to check them with his arms and 
his body.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second group who disparage our vernacular are disingenuous 
in the excuses they make. There are many who love to be thought masters 
even when they are not, and to avoid the contrary, that is not being so 
considered, they always blame the materials provided for their craft, or
 their tools. For example, a poor blacksmith criticises the iron 
supplied, and a bad lutanist criticises his lute, seeking to blame the 
bad knife-blade or the poor music on the iron or the lute, and deflect 
it from himself. In the same way there are quite a number who wish to be
 considered authors; and who, to excuse their not writing at all, or 
writing badly, accuse and blame their material, that is their own 
vernacular, and praise some other which they are not required to use. 
Whoever wants to know whether the iron deserves blame should look at 
what the fine craftsman makes of it, and he will then recognise the 
disingenuousness of the man who seeks to lay the blame on it, and 
thereby excuse himself. Cicero cries out against men of this sort, at 
the start of <em>De Finibus</em>, because in his day men found fault 
with Latin and praised Greek, for reasons similar to those men who judge
 Italian vile and Provençal beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third group who disparage our vernacular are possessed by an
 empty desire for glory. Many think they will be admired more for 
describing things in another language, and for praising it, than by 
doing so in their own. Certainly ability in learning a foreign language 
well is not unworthy of praise; but it is wrong to praise it beyond all 
truth in order to glory in its acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fourth group are driven by envious reasoning. As was said 
above, envy always arises from apparent equality. Among men sharing the 
same language there is common use of the vernacular; and because one man
 cannot deploy it as another does, envy arises. The envious man then 
blames that which provides the medium of his work, rather than his lack 
of ability in not knowing how to write, so that by disparaging the work 
on that basis he may deprive the poet of honour and fame; just like a 
man who blames the iron of the sword-blade in order to find fault not 
merely with the iron but with the craftsman’s entire labour.
    </p>
    <p>
        The firth and last group are motivated by baseness of mind. The 
pretentious man always magnifies himself in his own eyes, and, 
conversely, the pusillanimous man always considers himself less than he 
really is. Because magnifying and diminishing are always relative to 
something compared to which the pretentious man deems himself great and 
the pusillanimous small, the pretentious man always deems others less 
than they are, and the pusillanimous greater. Since a man rates himself 
as he rates his possessions, which are almost a part of himself, the 
pretentious man’s belongings always seem better than they are, to him, 
and those of others worse; the pusillanimous always believes his 
belongings to be worth little, and those of others to be worth much. 
Likewise many disparage their own vernacular, by devaluing it in this 
way, while praising that of others.
    </p>
    <p>
        All these groups taken together comprise the vile Italian 
wretches who despise this rich vernacular, which, if it is base in any 
way, is base only insofar as it issues from the meretricious lips of 
these adulterers, by whom the blind are lead, whom I mentioned in 
discussing the first group.

        <span id="anchor_Toc189547292">Chapter XII: The Vernacular: How Love of it is Engendered</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        If flames were seen issuing from the windows of a house, and one
 man asked if there was a fire inside, and another answered ‘yes’, I 
could not say which of the two more deserved ridicule. The question and 
answer would be just as ridiculous if someone were to ask me whether 
love of my native tongue resides within me and I answered ‘yes’, and for
 the same reason. Nevertheless, in order to demonstrate that not merely 
love but perfect love for the vernacular resides within me, and to 
censure its adversaries once more by demonstrating this to anyone who 
rightly understands, I will say how I became its adherent and how that 
adherence was strengthened. I say then, as Cicero writes in <em>De Amicitia</em>, agreeing with Aristotle’s opinion expressed in the eighth and ninth books of the <em>Ethics</em>,
 that closeness and virtue are the natural causes that engender love, 
while benefit, harmony of purpose, and familiarity are the causes of its
 increase. All these were present to engender and strengthen my love of 
the vernacular, as I will show briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
        A thing is said to be closest when, of all of its kind, it is 
most nearly related to another thing: so, the son is closest of all men 
to the father; the doctor adheres most closely to medicine of all the 
arts, and the musician to music, because their practice relates most 
closely to those arts. And so a man’s vernacular is closest to him, 
since it is the first and sole language in his mind before any other; 
and it is not only related to him <em>per se</em> but also contingently,
 since it is connected to those nearest to him, his kin, his fellow 
citizens, and his people. Such is one’s own vernacular, which is not 
merely close but supremely close to all. Therefore, if closeness is the 
seed of friendship, as has been said above, clearly it has been a cause 
of my love of my language, which is closer to me than others. The cause 
mentioned above, namely that what exists first and alone in the mind is 
most nearly related to it, led people to make the firstborn their heirs 
by custom, since they are the closest, and being closest the most loved.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, the vernacular’s virtues make me its friend. Here it 
should be noted that every virtue proper to something is worthy of love,
 as a full beard in a man and a face devoid of hair in a woman, as keen 
scent in a foxhound and turn of speed in a greyhound. The more 
appropriate to it, the more it is deserving of love; so, though every 
virtue in man is deserving of love, that which is most human is the most
 deserving, which is justice, residing in the rational or intellectual 
part, that is in the will. It is so deserving of love that, as Cicero 
says in <em>De Officiis</em>, even its enemies, such as thieves and 
robbers, love it; and therefore we see that its opposite, injustice, is 
most hated, for example as displayed in treachery, ingratitude, lying, 
deceit, petty theft, larceny, and the like. All of these are such 
inhuman sins, that to avoid being disgraced by them age-old custom 
allows a man to speak about himself, as has been mentioned earlier, in 
order to declare that he is true and loyal. Of this virtue I will speak 
more fully in the fourteenth book; and leaving it for now, I return to 
my subject.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has thus been shown that there is a virtue most fitting to a 
thing; and that what is most loved and praised in it is this virtue. Now
 we see that in all things relating to speech what is most praised is 
the fitting expression of thought: therefore this is its prime virtue. 
Since this virtue is found in our vernacular, as has been shown clearly 
in an earlier chapter, then this is a cause of the love I bear it, since
 virtue, as has been said, is the thing that engenders love.
    </p>
    <p class="line-break"></p>
    <h3 class="text-center">
        <span id="anchor_Toc189547293">Chapter XIII: The Vernacular: How Love of it is Strengthened</span>
    </h3>
    <p class="no-indent-dc">
        Having described the two characteristics of my native tongue 
which had made me adhere to it, that is its closeness to me and its 
proper virtue, I will say how that adherence is strengthened and 
increased through its benefits, through harmony of purpose, and through a
 sense of benevolence born of long familiarity. Firstly I affirm that I 
have myself received great benefit from it. We know that among benefits,
 the greatest is that most precious to the recipient; and nothing is as 
precious as that for which all else is desired, and all else is desired 
for the perfection of him who desires it. Thus, since man has two 
perfections, one primary and one secondary, the first causing him to 
exist, the second causing him to be virtuous, then, if my native tongue 
has been the cause of both, I have received great benefit from it. That 
my native tongue has been the cause of my existence and of my being 
virtuous, unless I should fail through my own fault, may be shown 
briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Aristotle, in the second book of his <em>Physics</em>,
 it is possible for things to have several efficient causes, though one 
among them is the principal; so fire and hammer are efficient causes of 
the forged blade, though the blacksmith is the principal one. This 
vernacular of mine brought my parents together, since they conversed in 
it, just as the fire prepares the iron for the smith who forges the 
blade; and thus it is evident that it contributed to my generation, and 
was the cause of my being. Moreover, this vernacular of mine was what 
led me into the path of knowledge, which is our ultimate perfection, 
since through it I entered upon Latin and through its means Latin was 
taught me, which then formed the path to my future progress. So it is 
clear that the vernacular has been of great benefit to me, and this I 
acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, it had the same purpose as I, and this I can show as 
follows. Everything by nature seeks its own preservation; thus if the 
vernacular could seek anything itself, it would seek this; that is to 
secure itself greater permanence, and it could only achieve greater 
permanence by binding itself to metre and rhyme. This has so clearly 
been my aim that it needs no proof. Thus, its purpose and mine have been
 one and the same, and through this harmony my adherence has been 
strengthened and increased. Also, there has been a sense of benevolence 
born of familiarity; for from childhood I have looked on it with 
benevolence and been intimate with it, and have utilised it in order to 
think, explain and question. Thus, if friendship increases through 
familiarity, as seems obvious to the senses, it is clear that it has 
greatly increased in me, since I have used it all my life. So we see 
that all the causes that engender and increase friendship have united in
 this friendship, from which we must conclude that what I ought to show,
 and do show for it, is not simply love but perfect love.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking back then, and gathering together all the reasons noted, we can see that this bread, with which the following <em>canzoni</em>
 should be eaten, is adequately cleansed of its impurities, and excused 
for being made of oats. Thus it is time to think of serving the meat. 
This commentary is the bread made of finest wheat with which thousands 
shall be satiated, and my basket shall be full to overflowing with it. 
This shall be a fresh light, a fresh sun that will rise where the old 
sun sets, and give light to those who lie in shadow and darkness since 
the old sun no longer sheds its light on them.
