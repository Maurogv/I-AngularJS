<p align="JUSTIFY"><b><i><a name="01"></a>Chapter 1</i></b></p>
<p>As the Philosopher says at the beginning of the&nbsp;<i>First Philosophy</i>, all men by nature desire to know.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>&nbsp;The
 reason for this can be and is that each thing, impelled by a force 
provided by its own nature, inclines towards its own perfection. Since 
knowledge is the ultimate perfection of our soul, in which resides our 
ultimate happiness, we are all therefore by nature subject to a desire 
for it. Many are, however, deprived of this most noble perfection by 
various causes within and outside of man which remove him from the habit
 of knowledge. Within man there exist two kinds of defects which impede 
him, one pertaining to the body, the other to the soul. That pertaining 
to the body occurs when its parts are not properly disposed, so that it 
can receive nothing, as is the case with the deaf, the dumb, and the 
like. That pertaining to the soul occurs when malice overcomes it, so 
that it becomes the follower of vicious pleasures, by which it is so 
deceived that because of them it degrades the worth of all things. 
Likewise outside of man two causes may be discerned, one of which 
subjects him to necessity, the other to indolence. The first consists of
 domestic and civic responsibilities, which properly engage the greater 
number of men, so that they are permitted no time for contemplation. The
 other is the handicap that derives from the place where a person is 
born and bred, which at times will not only lack a university but be far
 removed from the company of educated persons.</p>
<p>Two of these causes, namely the first from within and the first from 
outside, are not to be blamed but excused and are deserving of pardon; 
the other two, although one more than the other, deserve our censure and
 scorn. Anyone therefore can plainly see upon careful reflection that 
there remain few who are capable of achieving the habit of knowledge 
desired by all, and that the handicapped who live forever starved of 
this food are almost too numerous to count. Blessed are the few who sit 
at the table where the bread of the angels is eaten, and most 
unfortunate those who share the food of sheep!<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p>But since man is by nature a friend of all men, and every friend is 
grieved by defects found in the one he loves, they who are fed at so 
lofty a table are not without compassion toward those whom they see 
grazing about on grass and acorns in animal pastures. And since 
compassion is the mother of generosity, they who possess knowledge 
always give liberally of their great riches to the truly poor and are 
like a living fountain by whose waters the natural thirst referred to 
above is quenched.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>&nbsp;Therefore I 
(who do not sit at the blessed table, but, having fled the pasture of 
the common herd, gather up a part of what falls to the feet of those who
 do sit there, and who know the unfortunate life of those I have left 
behind, for the sweetness that I taste in what I gather up piece by 
piece, and moved by compassion, though not forgetting myself) have set 
aside for those who are unfortunate something that I placed before their
 eyes some time ago, by which I have increased their desire.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup></p>
<p>Wishing now to set their table, I intend to present to all men a 
banquet of what I have shown them and of the bread which must 
necessarily accompany such meat, without which it could not be consumed 
by them. This banquet, being worthy of such bread, offers meat which I 
intend should not be served in vain. Therefore I would not have anyone 
be seated there whose organs are ill-disposed because he lacks teeth, 
tongue, or palate, nor anyone addicted to vice, for his stomach is so 
full of poisonous and contrary humors that it would not be able to 
retain my meat. But let come here all those whose human hunger derives 
from domestic or civic responsibilities, and let them sit at the same 
table with others likewise handicapped; and at their feet let all those 
place themselves who do not merit a higher seat because of their 
indolence; and let each group partake of my meat with bread, for I will 
have them both taste of it and digest it. The meat of this banquet will 
be prepared in fourteen ways: that is, in fourteen canzoni, whose 
subject is both love as well as virtue. By lacking the present bread 
they possessed some degree of obscurity, so that to many their beauty 
was more pleasing than their goodness. But this bread (that is, the 
present explanation) will be the light that renders visible every shade 
of their meaning.</p>
<p>If in the present work, which is called&nbsp;<i>The Banquet</i>, as I wish it to be, the subject is treated more maturely than in the&nbsp;<i>Vita Nuova</i>,
 I do not intend by this in any way to disparage that book but rather 
more greatly to support it with this one, seeing that it understandably 
suits that one to be fervid and passionate, and this one tempered and 
mature.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>&nbsp;For it is proper to speak
 and act differently at different ages, because certain manners are 
fitting and praiseworthy at one age which at another are unbecoming and 
blameworthy, as will be shown below with appropriate reasoning in the 
fourth book. I wrote the former work at the threshold of my youth, and 
this one after I had already passed through it. Since my true meaning 
was other than what the previously mentioned canzoni outwardly reveal, I
 intend to explain these canzoni by means of an allegorical exposition, 
after having discussed the literal account, so that both arguments will 
be savored by those who have been invited to this supper. And if the 
banquet does not fulfill their expectations, I ask them to attribute 
every shortcoming not to my will but to my capability; for here it is my
 desire to be a disciple of complete and loving generosity.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="02"></a>Chapter 2</i></b></p>
<p>At the beginning of every well-ordered banquet the servants 
customarily take the bread placed on the table and cleanse it of any 
impurity. So I, who stand in their place in the present work, intend 
first of all to cleanse two impurities from this exposition, which 
passes for bread in my provision. The first is that for someone to speak
 of himself seems impermissible; the other is that to speak of matters 
by going into them too deeply seems unreasonable; and in this way the 
knife of my judgment will strip away the impermissible and the 
unreasonable. The rhetoricians grant no one the right to speak of 
himself, except in the case of necessity, and one is restricted from 
doing this because in speaking about someone the speaker cannot avoid 
praising or blaming the person about whom he speaks, and these two kinds
 of speech are crude since they come from one’s own lips.</p>
<p>To dispel a doubt that may arise here, I say that it is worse to 
blame than to praise, although one should refrain from doing either. The
 reason is that anything that is blameworthy in itself is more repugnant
 than something only incidentally blameworthy. To disparage oneself is 
in itself blameworthy, because a person should tell a friend of his 
faults in private. No one is a better friend than one is to himself; 
therefore it is in the chamber of one’s thoughts that a person must 
reprimand himself and bemoan his faults, and not openly. Moreover, a 
person is usually not blamed for not being able or not knowing how to 
conduct himself properly, but always for not being willing to, because 
good and evil are determined by what we will or fail to will; therefore 
he who blames himself shows that he accepts his faults, accepts that he 
is not good; thus speaking of oneself with blame is in itself to be 
rejected. Self-praise is to be avoided as an incidental evil, since one 
cannot give praise without its being mostly blame.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup>&nbsp;It
 may be praise on the surface of the words, but it is blame to him who 
seeks out their substance; for words are made to reveal what is not 
known; hence one who praises himself reveals that he does not believe 
himself to be esteemed, which is something that does not happen unless 
he has a bad conscience, which he discloses by praising himself; and by 
disclosing it, he blames himself.</p>
<p>Moreover, self-praise and self-blame must be avoided for the same 
reason, just like bearing false witness; for there is no one who can 
take measure of himself in a manner that is true and just, so much are 
we deceived by our self-love. It happens that in judging the self 
everyone uses the measures of a dishonest merchant who buys using one 
measure and sells using another; for everyone measures his bad deeds 
with a long measure and his good deeds with a short one so that the 
number, size, and weight of the good deeds appear to him greater than if
 he had assessed them with a true measure, and less in the case of the 
bad deeds. Thus in speaking of himself with praise or its contrary, he 
either speaks falsely with respect to the circumstance he is talking 
about, or he speaks falsely with respect to its importance, which 
comprises both falsehoods. Furthermore, because silence signifies 
agreement, he who praises or blames someone to his face acts 
discourteously, since the person so judged can neither agree nor 
disagree without falling into the error of praising or blaming 
himself–except in those instances in which correction is deserved, which
 cannot be accomplished without reproving the error meant to be 
corrected, and in those instances in which honor and praise are 
deserved, which cannot be accomplished without some mention of virtuous 
deeds and honors virtuously acquired.</p>
<p>To return to the main topic, however, I say that (as touched on 
above) speaking about oneself is allowed in cases of necessity, and 
among the several cases of necessity two are very evident. One is when 
great infamy or danger cannot be avoided except by talking about 
oneself; then it is permissible, for the reason that to take the less 
evil of two paths is almost the same as taking a good one. This 
necessity moved Boethius to speak of himself, so that under the pretext 
of consolation he might defend himself against the perpetual infamy of 
his exile, by showing it to be unjust, since no other apologist came 
forward.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup>&nbsp;The other arises when by
 speaking of oneself very great benefit comes to another by way of 
instruction; and this reason moved Augustine to speak of himself in 
his&nbsp;<i>Confessions</i>, because by the progress of his life, which 
proceeded from bad to good, good to better, and better to best, he gave 
us an example and instruction which could not be provided by any other 
testimony so true as this.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, if each of these reasons may serve as my excuse, the 
bread made from my wheat is sufficiently cleansed of its first impurity.
 A fear of infamy moves me, and a desire to give instruction moves me, 
which in truth others are unable to give. I fear the infamy of having 
yielded myself to the great passion that anyone who reads the canzoni 
mentioned above must realize once ruled me. This infamy will altogether 
cease as I speak now about myself and show that my motivation was not 
passion but virtue. I intend also to show the true meaning of the 
canzoni, which no one can perceive unless I reveal it, because it is 
hidden beneath the figure of allegory. This will not only bring true 
delight to the ear but as well useful instruction concerning both this 
mode of speaking and this mode of understanding the writings of others.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="03"></a>Chapter 3</i></b></p>
<p>Deserving of severe censure is that action which, while intended to 
remove some defect, itself introduces it, like the man who was sent to 
break up a quarrel, and before breaking it up began another. Now that my
 bread has been cleansed on the one side, it is necessary for me to 
cleanse it on the other to escape a censure of this kind, for my 
writing, which can almost be called a commentary, is intended to remove 
the defect of the canzoni mentioned above, and this may itself prove to 
be perhaps a little difficult in part. This difficulty is deliberate 
here so as to escape a greater defect, and is not due to a lack of 
knowledge. Ah, if only it had pleased the Maker of the Universe that the
 cause of my apology had never existed, for then neither would others 
have sinned against me, nor would I have suffered punishment 
unjustly–the punishment, I mean, of exile and poverty.</p>
<p>Since it was the pleasure of the citizens of the most beautiful and 
famous daughter of Rome, Florence, to cast me out of her sweet 
bosom–where I was born and bred up to the pinnacle of my life, and 
where, with her good will, I desire with all my heart to rest my weary 
mind and to complete the span of time that is given to me–I have 
traveled like a stranger, almost like a beggar, through virtually all 
the regions to which this tongue of ours extends, displaying against my 
will the wound of fortune for which the wounded one is often unjustly 
accustomed to be held accountable.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup>&nbsp;Truly
 I have been a ship without sail or rudder, brought to different ports, 
inlets, and shores by the dry wind that painful poverty blows. And I 
have appeared before the eyes of many who perhaps because of some report
 had imagined me in another form. In their sight not only was my person 
held cheap, but each of my works was less valued, those already 
completed as much as those yet to come. The reason why this happens, not
 only to me but to everyone, I briefly wish to touch on here: first, 
because esteem inflates things with respect to the truth, and secondly, 
because presence diminishes things with respect to the truth.</p>
<p>A good reputation is principally engendered by good thoughts in the 
mind of a friend, and this is how it is first brought to birth; for the 
mind of an enemy, even though it receives the seed, does not conceive. 
That mind which first gives birth to it, both to make its gift more fair
 and for the love of the friend who receives it, does not confine itself
 within the limits of the truth, but oversteps them. When the mind 
oversteps them in order to embellish what it affirms, it speaks against 
conscience; when an error arising from love makes it overstep them, it 
does not speak against it. The second mind which receives what is said 
is content not only with the amplification supplied by the first but 
seeks to embellish it by transmitting it further, as if it were of his 
own making–and so much so that through this act and through the error 
caused by the love generated in it, it increases a reputation beyond 
what it originally was, whether, like the first mind, in accord or in 
discord with conscience. The third mind that receives it does the same, 
and the fourth, and hence it is inflated infinitely. And so, by 
reversing the above-mentioned motives to the contrary, one can perceive 
the reason for infamy, which increases in the same manner. Thus Vergil 
says in the fourth book of the&nbsp;<i>Aeneid</i>&nbsp;that “Fame thrives on movement and acquires greatness by going about.”<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>Anyone
 who wishes, then, can clearly see that the image generated by fame 
alone is always greater, no matter what kind it is, than the thing 
imagined is in its true state.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="04"></a>Chapter 4</i></b></p>
<p>Having presented just now the reason why fame inflates good and evil 
beyond their true dimension, it remains in this chapter to present those
 reasons which reveal why presence on the contrary diminishes them; and 
after presenting them, we will quickly come to the main topic, that is, 
the excuse mentioned above.</p>
<p>I say then that there are three reasons why a man’s presence makes 
him less worthy than he really is. The first of these is immaturity, and
 I do not mean of age but of mind; the second is envy–and these two 
reside in the one who judges; the third is human imperfection–and this 
resides in the person judged.</p>
<p>The first can be briefly discussed as follows. The majority of men 
live according to the senses and not according to reason, like children;
 as such they do not understand things except simply by their exterior, 
and they do not perceive the goodness of things, which is ordained to a 
proper end, because they keep shut the eyes of reason which penetrate to
 a vision of it. Therefore they quickly see all that they are able to, 
and judge according to their sight. And since they form some opinion 
regarding another man’s fame by hearsay, with which, in the person’s 
presence, their imperfect judgment clashes, which judges not by reason 
but only by the senses, they regard as a lie what they have previously 
heard and disparage the person they have previously esteemed. Hence with
 these, who comprise, alas, almost all of humanity, a man’s presence 
diminishes the one and the other quality. Such people as these are soon 
charmed and soon sated, are often glad and often sad with brief delights
 and sorrows, soon become friends and soon enemies; they do everything 
like children, without the use of reason.</p>
<p>The second is seen by these reasons: that in vicious people equality 
causes envy, and envy causes bad judgment, because it does not allow the
 reason to argue on behalf of whatever is envied, and the faculty of 
judgment is then like a judge that hears only one side. Hence when such 
people as these see a famous person, they become immediately envious, 
because they see limbs and powers very much like their own, and they 
fear, because of the excellence of that person, that they will be less 
esteemed. These people who are moved by passion not only judge wrongly, 
but by defaming cause others to judge wrongly too; consequently with 
them presence diminishes the good and evil in each person presented to 
them; and I say “evil” because many, taking delight in evil deeds, are 
envious of evil-doers.</p>
<p>The third reason is human imperfection, which attaches to him who is 
judged and does not obtain without some familiarity and intimacy with 
him. To make this clear, we must observe that man is blemished in many 
ways, for as Augustine says, “no one is without blemish.” Sometimes a 
person is blemished by a passion which occasionally he cannot resist; 
sometimes he is blemished by some physical deformity; sometimes he is 
blemished by some stroke of misfortune; and sometimes he is blemished by
 the infamy of his parents or someone close to him. Fame does not bear 
these things with itself, whereas presence does, revealing them through 
intimacy. These blemishes cast a shadow on the brightness of his 
goodness, so that they make it seem less bright and less worthy. This is
 the reason why every prophet is less honored in his own country; this 
is the reason why a good man should vouchsafe his presence to few and 
his intimacy to still fewer, so that his name may be known, but not 
disparaged. This third cause may obtain for evil as well as for good, if
 each term in the argument is turned to its opposite. Thus it is clearly
 seen that because of imperfection, from which no man is free, presence 
diminishes the good and the evil in everyone more than truth warrants.</p>
<p>Therefore since, as has been said above, I have presented myself to 
virtually everyone in Italy, by which I have perhaps made myself more 
base than truth warrants, not only to those to whom my fame had already 
spread but also to others, whereby my works as well as my person are 
without doubt made light of, it is fitting that I should add, with a 
loftier style, a little weight to the present work, so that it may seem 
to take on an air of greater authority. This should suffice to excuse 
the difficulty of my commentary.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="05"></a>Chapter 5</i></b></p>
<p>Now that this bread is cleansed of its accidental impurities, it 
remains to apologize for one pertaining to substance, that is, for its 
being in the vernacular and not in Latin; which is to say, by way of 
metaphor, for its being made of oats and not of wheat.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup>&nbsp;This
 impurity is excused in few words for three reasons which have moved me 
to choose this language rather than the other: the first arises from 
precaution against creating an inappropriate relationship; the next from
 zealous generosity; the third from natural love of one’s native tongue.
 And to counter an objection that might be made for the above-mentioned 
reason, I intend to discuss these points on their own basis in the 
following order.</p>
<p>What most adorns and commends human actions and what most directly 
leads them to a good end is the habit of those dispositions which are 
directed to an intended end, as, for example, boldness of mind and 
strength of body are directed to the end of chivalry. So anyone who is 
placed into the service of another must have those dispositions which 
are directed to that end, such as submission, understanding, and 
obedience, without which a man is not equipped to serve well. For if he 
is not submissive in all of his functions, he will always perform his 
service with effort and strain and will rarely continue in it; and if he
 is not understanding of the needs of his master and is not obedient to 
him, he will never serve except according to his own judgment and his 
own will, which is more the service of a friend than that of a servant. 
Hence, to avoid this inappropriate relationship, it is fitting that this
 commentary, which is made to play the part of a servant to the canzoni 
placed below, be subject to them in all of its functions and be 
understanding of the needs of its master and obedient to him.</p>
<p>All of these dispositions would be lacking if it had been in Latin 
and not in the vernacular, since the canzoni are in the vernacular. For 
in the first place it would not have been subject but sovereign, because
 of its nobility, its virtue, and its beauty. Because of its nobility, 
for Latin is eternal and incorruptible, while the vernacular is unstable
 and corruptible. Thus in the ancient Latin comedies and tragedies, 
which cannot undergo change, we find the same Latin as we have today; 
this is not the case with the vernacular, which, being fashioned 
according to one’s own preference, undergoes change. Thus in the cities 
of Italy, if we care to take a close look, we find that within the last 
fifty years many words have become obsolete, been born, and been 
altered; if a short period of time changes language, much more does a 
greater period change it. Thus I say that if those who departed this 
life a thousand years ago were to return to their cities, they would 
believe that they were occupied by foreigners, because the language 
would be at variance with their own. This will be more fully discussed 
elsewhere in a book I intend to write, God willing, on&nbsp;<i>Eloquence in the Vernacular</i>.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, Latin would not have been subject but sovereign because of 
its virtue. Everything is virtuous in its nature which fulfills the 
purpose toward which it is directed; and the better it does this, the 
more virtuous it is. Therefore we call a man virtuous who lives a 
contemplative or an active life, which he is by nature constituted to 
do; we call a horse virtuous which runs fast and far, which it is 
constituted to do; we call a sword virtuous which cuts through hard 
objects easily, which it is constituted to do. Thus language, which is 
constituted to express human thought, is virtuous when it does this, and
 the more completely it does this, the more virtuous it is; therefore, 
since Latin expresses many things conceived in the mind which the 
vernacular cannot, as those who speak both languages know, its virtue is
 greater than that of the vernacular.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Latin would not have been the subject but the sovereign 
because of its beauty. One calls a thing beautiful when its parts 
correspond properly, because pleasure results from their harmony. Thus a
 man appears beautiful when his limbs correspond properly; and we call a
 song beautiful when its voices are harmonized according to the rules of
 the art. Therefore that language is the most beautiful in which the 
words correspond most properly; and they correspond more properly in 
Latin than in the vernacular, because the vernacular follows custom, 
while Latin follows art;<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup>&nbsp;consequently
 it is granted that Latin is the more beautiful, the more virtuous, and 
the more noble. And this concludes my main point: that is, that Latin 
would not have been the subject of the canzoni but their sovereign.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="06"></a>Chapter 6</i></b></p>
<p>Having shown how the present commentary would not have been subject 
to the vernacular canzoni if it had been in Latin, it remains to show 
how it would not have understood them nor have been obedient to them; 
and then we will reach the conclusion that to avoid creating an 
inappropriate relationship it was necessary to speak in the vernacular. I
 say that Latin would not have been an understanding servant to its 
vernacular master for the following reason. The servant’s understanding 
requires, above all, his understanding two things perfectly. One is the 
nature of his master. Now there are masters of so asinine a nature that 
they order the opposite of what they desire, and others who without 
uttering a word expect to be understood, and others who do not want a 
servant to set about doing what is necessary unless they order it. Why 
there are these differences in men I do not intend to explain at present
 (for this would make the digression much too long), except insofar as 
to say that in general such men whom reason so little benefits are all 
but animals. Therefore if the servant does not understand his master’s 
nature, it is evident that he cannot serve him perfectly. The other 
point is that the servant must understand the friends of his master, for
 otherwise he could not honor or serve them, and consequently he would 
not serve his master perfectly; for friends are like the parts of a 
whole, since their whole consists of unity in willing and in not 
willing.</p>
<p>Neither would the Latin commentary have understood these things, 
which the vernacular itself does. That Latin does not understand the 
vernacular and its friends is proved as follows. He who knows a thing in
 general does not know it perfectly, just as anyone who recognizes an 
animal from a distance does not recognize it perfectly because he does 
not know whether it is a dog, a wolf, or a goat. Latin understands the 
vernacular in general, but not in particular, for if it understood it in
 particular it would understand all the vernaculars, because there is no
 reason why it should understand one better than another. So any man 
having perfect knowledge of Latin would have the habit of understanding 
the vernacular in particular. But this is not the case, for a person 
having perfect knowledge of Latin does not distinguish, if he is from 
Italy, the English vernacular from the German; nor if a German, the 
Italian vernacular from the Provençal. Thus it is evident that Latin 
does not understand the vernacular.</p>
<p>Moreover, it does not understand its friends, since it is impossible 
to know a person’s friends without first knowing the person; therefore 
if Latin does not know the vernacular, as proved above, it is impossible
 for it to know its friends. Moreover, without intimacy and familiarity 
it is impossible to know people, and Latin does not have an affiliation 
with as many people in any language as does the vernacular of that 
language, to which all are friends; consequently it cannot know the 
friends of the vernacular. It is not a contradiction to say, as one 
might, that Latin all the same does have an association with certain 
friends of the vernacular; for, it is not therefore familiar with all of
 them, and so does not understand its friends perfectly, since perfect 
and not defective knowledge is required.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="07"></a>Chapter 7</i></b></p>
<p>Having proved that a Latin commentary would not have been an 
understanding servant, I will tell why it would not have been obedient. 
He is obedient who has that good disposition which is called obedience. 
True obedience should have three things, without which it cannot exist: 
it should be sweet and not bitter, entirely under command and not 
self-willed, and within measure and not beyond measure. These three 
things a Latin commentary could not possibly have possessed, and 
therefore it would have been impossible for it to be obedient. That this
 would have been impossible for Latin, as has been said, is made clear 
by the following reasoning: everything that proceeds by inverse order is
 disagreeable, and consequently is bitter and not sweet, as, for 
example, sleeping during the day and lying awake at night, or going 
backwards and not forwards. For the subject to command the sovereign is 
to proceed by inverse order (for the right order is for the sovereign to
 command the servant); so it is bitter and not sweet. And since it is 
impossible to obey a bitter command with sweetness, it is impossible for
 the sovereign’s obedience to be sweet when a subject commands. 
Therefore, if Latin is the sovereign of the vernacular, as has been 
shown above by many reasons, and the canzoni which play the role of 
commander are in the vernacular, it is impossible for its obedience to 
be sweet.</p>
<p>Moreover, obedience is entirely under command and in no way 
self-willed when the person who obeys would not have acted on his own 
initiative without a command, either entirely or in part. Therefore if I
 were commanded to wear two robes, and without being commanded should 
put on but one, I would say that my obedience is not entirely the result
 of a command but in part self-willed. Such would have been the 
obedience of the Latin commentary, and consequently it would not have 
been entirely the result of a command. That such would have been the 
case is clear from this: that without having been commanded by this 
master, Latin would have explained many aspects of his meaning–and it 
does explain them, as he who carefully examines writings written in 
Latin knows–which the vernacular in no way does.</p>
<p>Moreover, obedience is within measure and not beyond measure when it 
goes to the limit of the command, and not beyond it, just as individual 
nature is obedient to universal nature when it gives a man thirty-two 
teeth, neither more nor less, and when it gives the hand five fingers, 
neither more nor less; and man is obedient to justice when he makes a 
sinner pay his debt to society, neither more nor less than justice 
demands. Now Latin would not have done this, but would have sinned not 
only through deficiency, and not only through excess, but through both; 
and so its obedience would not have been within measure, but beyond 
measure, and consequently it would not have been obedient. That Latin 
would not have fulfilled the command of its master and that it would 
have exceeded it can easily be shown. This master, that is, these 
canzoni to which this commentary is constituted as servant, command and 
desire that their meaning be explained to all who can comprehend it, so 
that when their words are heard they will be understood. And no one 
doubts, were they to make their command heard, that this would be their 
command. Latin would not have explained them except to the learned, for 
no one else would have understood it. Therefore, since among those who 
desire to understand them the unlearned are far more numerous than the 
learned, it follows that Latin would not have fulfilled their command as
 well as the vernacular, which is understood by the learned and the 
unlearned alike.</p>
<p>Moreover, Latin would have explained them to people of other 
languages, such as the Germans and the English and others, and here it 
would have exceeded their command; for it would have been against their 
will (broadly speaking, I say) for their meaning to have been explained 
where they could not convey it together with their beauty. Therefore 
everyone should know that nothing harmonized according to the rules of 
poetry can be translated from its native tongue into another without 
destroying all its sweetness and harmony. This is the reason why Homer 
has not been translated from Greek into Latin as have been other 
writings we have of theirs. And this is the reason why the verses of the
 Psalter lack the sweetness of music and harmony; for they were 
translated from Hebrew into Greek and from Greek into Latin, and in the 
first translation all their sweetness was lost. Thus I have fully dealt 
with what was promised at the beginning of the chapter immediately 
preceding this one.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="08"></a>Chapter 8</i></b></p>
<p>Now that it has been shown by sufficient reasons that to avoid an 
inappropriate relationship a commentary in the vernacular and not in 
Latin would be necessary for unfolding and explaining the canzoni 
mentioned above, I intend also to show how complete generosity made me 
choose the former and forgo the latter. Now complete generosity may be 
observed in three things which are a consequence of using the vernacular
 and which would not have been a consequence of using Latin. The first 
is giving to many; the second is giving useful things; the third is 
giving a gift without its being asked.</p>
<p>It is good to give to and to help one, but it is complete goodness to
 give to and to help many in that it resembles the beneficence of God, 
who is the most universal benefactor. Moreover, to give to many without 
giving to one is impossible, since the one is included in the many; 
however, it is quite possible to give to one without giving to many. 
Therefore he who helps many does the one good and the other as well; he 
who helps one does only the one good; and hence we see that lawmakers 
keep their eyes fixed chiefly on the common good when making laws. 
Moreover, to give things that are not useful to the recipient is also 
good, in that he who gives knows at least that he is a friend; but it is
 not perfectly good, and so it is not complete, as, for example, if a 
knight were to give a shield to a doctor, or a doctor were to give a 
knight a copy of Hippocrates’&nbsp;<i>Aphorisms</i>&nbsp;or Galen’s&nbsp;<i>Art</i>.
 Therefore the wise say that the face of a gift must resemble that of 
the recipient, that is to say, it should be appropriate and useful to 
him; and in this the generosity of him who is discerning in his gifts is
 called complete.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>&nbsp;But since a 
discussion of ethics usually engenders a desire to ascertain their 
origin, I intend in this chapter briefly to point out four reasons why a
 gift, in order for it to manifest complete generosity, should be useful
 to the person who receives it.</p>
<p>First, because virtue must be cheerful, and not sad in any of its 
acts; therefore, if the gift is not cheerful in the giving and in the 
receiving, there is in it neither perfect nor complete virtue. This 
cheerfulness can be vouchsafed by nothing but usefulness which abides in
 the giver through giving and which comes to the recipient through 
receiving. The giver, therefore, must have the foresight to act so that 
on his side there remains the usefulness of integrity which surpasses 
every usefulness, and so that the usefulness of using the thing given 
passes to the recipient; in this way both will be cheerful, and 
consequently generosity will be the more complete.</p>
<p>Second, because virtue must always move things toward the better; 
for, as it would be a blameworthy act to turn a fine sword into a spade 
or a beautiful lute into a beautiful goblet, so it is blameworthy to 
move a thing from a place where it is useful and convey it to a place 
where it will be less useful. And since it is blameworthy to work in 
vain, it is blameworthy not only to put a thing in a place where it is 
less useful but even in a place where it is equally useful. Therefore, 
for a change in things to be praiseworthy, it must always be for the 
better, because it should be praiseworthy in the highest degree, and it 
cannot do this in a gift unless the gift becomes more precious through 
its transfer; and it cannot become more precious unless it is more 
useful to the recipient than to the giver. From this we may conclude 
that the gift, if it is to manifest complete generosity, must be useful 
to the person who receives it.</p>
<p>Third, because the exercise of virtue in itself should be to acquire 
friends, since our life has such a need, and the end of virtue is to 
make ourselves content. Therefore, for a gift to make a friend of the 
recipient, it must be useful to him, because usefulness stamps the image
 of the gift in his memory–which is the nourishment of friendship–and 
much more strongly the greater it is. Thus Martin is used to saying, 
“The gift that John gave me will never fade from my mind.”<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>&nbsp;So
 that, for the gift to have its virtue, which is generosity, and for it 
to be complete, it must be useful to the person receiving it.</p>
<p>Finally, virtue must be free in its action and not compelled. Action 
is free when a person goes willingly in some direction, as is evident 
from his keeping his face turned in that direction; action is compelled 
when a man acts against his will, as is shown by his not looking in the 
direction in which he is going. Now a gift looks in such a direction 
when it is directed to the needs of the recipient. Since it cannot be so
 directed if it is not useful, it is necessary that virtue, in order for
 it to move with free action, accompany the gift in the direction in 
which it goes, which is to the recipient; consequently the gift must be 
useful to the recipient in order for there to be complete generosity in 
it.</p>
<p>The third trait in which complete generosity can be observed is 
giving without being asked, because a thing asked for is on one side a 
matter of commerce, not virtue, since the recipient buys even though the
 giver does not sell. This is why Seneca says that “nothing is so dearly
 bought as that which is paid for with prayers.”<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>&nbsp;In
 order therefore that there may be complete generosity in the gift and 
that it be manifest in it, it must be free from every act of commerce: 
the gift must be unasked. Why what is prayed for costs so much I do not 
intend to discuss here, because it will be discussed sufficiently in the
 last book of this work.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="09"></a>Chapter 9</i></b></p>
<p>From all three of the above-mentioned conditions, all of which must 
be met in order for complete generosity to be found in a benefit, the 
Latin commentary was remote, whereas the vernacular is close to them, 
which can be plainly demonstrated as follows. Latin would not have 
served many, for, if we call to mind what was said above, the learned to
 whom the Italian language is foreign could not have availed themselves 
of this service; and regarding those who are native to this language, if
 we wish to consider who they are, we shall find that out of a thousand 
not one would have been served in a reasonable manner, because they 
would not have received it, so prone are they to avarice that it 
deprives them of all nobility of mind, a virtue that desires this food 
above all. To their shame I say that they should not be called learned, 
because they do not acquire learning for its own use but only insofar as
 through it they may gain money or honor; just as we should not call a 
lute-player someone who keeps a lute in his house for the purpose of 
renting it out, as opposed to playing on it.</p>
<p>Returning to the main proposition, I say that it may clearly be seen 
that Latin would have conferred its benefits on few while the vernacular
 will be of service to many. For goodness of mind, which this service 
attends to, is found in those who because of the world’s wicked neglect 
of good have left literature to those who have changed it from a lady 
into a whore; and these noble persons comprise princes, barons, knights,
 and many other noble people, not only men but women, of which there are
 many in this language who know only the vernacular and are not learned.</p>
<p>Moreover, Latin would not have been the giver of a useful gift as 
will the vernacular, because nothing is useful except insofar as it is 
used. Nor does its goodness reside in potentiality, which is not a 
perfect state of being, just as in the case of gold, pearls, and other 
treasures that lie buried, and I speak only of what is buried, because 
what is in the hands of the miser lies in a place lower than the ground 
in which treasure is hidden. The true gift of this commentary lies in 
the meaning of the canzoni for which it is made, meaning which is 
intended above all to lead men to knowledge and virtue, as will be seen 
in the full course of their treatment. This meaning can be of use only 
to those in whom true nobility is sown, in the manner that will be 
described below in the fourth book; and almost all of these persons know
 only the vernacular, like the noble men and women referred to earlier 
in this chapter. No contradiction arises even if there are some learned 
persons to be found among them; for, as my master Aristotle says in the 
first book of the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>, “one swallow does not make 
spring.” It is therefore evident that the vernacular will provide 
something useful and that Latin would not have provided it.</p>
<p>Moreover, the vernacular will give a gift unasked, which Latin would 
not have done, because it will give itself as a commentary, something 
that no one has ever asked for; and this cannot be said of Latin, which 
has already been asked for as a commentary and a gloss on many writings,
 as may readily be seen at the beginning of many of them. And so it is 
evident that complete generosity moved me to employ the vernacular 
rather than Latin.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="10"></a>Chapter 10</i></b></p>
<p>A full apology should be made for serving oaten and not wheaten bread
 at a banquet so noble in its meat and so distinguished in its guests, 
and the reason why a man departs from what has long been the practice of
 others, namely, the use of Latin in commentaries, should be evident. 
Therefore the reason needs to be made clear, for the end of new things 
is not certain, since that experience has not yet been had by means of 
which things long observed and long in use are measured both as to their
 progress and as to their end. This is why the Law was moved to command 
that a man should take great care in entering on a new path, saying that
 “in establishing new things, the reason that makes us depart from what 
has long been in use must be evident.”<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup></p>
<p>No one should be surprised, then, if the digression that I make in 
stating my apology proves lengthy, but since it is necessary let him 
bear its length patiently. In pursuing this further (since it has been 
shown how I was moved to employ the vernacular commentary and forsake 
Latin in order to avoid an inappropriate relationship and by reason of 
complete generosity), I say that the nature of my full apology requires 
me to show how I was moved to this act through natural love of my native
 tongue, which is the third and final reason that moved me to it. I say 
that natural love above all moves the lover to do three things: first, 
to magnify the loved object; second, to be jealous for it; next, to 
defend it, as everyone can observe happens continually. These three 
things made me adopt it, that is, our vernacular, which naturally and 
accidentally I love and have loved. I was moved in the first place to 
magnify it, and in what way I magnify it may be seen by the following 
argument.</p>
<p>Now things can be magnified, that is, made great, by many conditions 
of greatness, and nothing makes them so great as the greatness of their 
own goodness, which is the mother and preserver of all other kinds of 
greatness–for man can have no greatness greater than that of virtuous 
action, which is his own proper excellence, by which the greatness of 
true dignity, true honor, true power, true riches, true friends, and 
true and glorious fame are both acquired and preserved–and this 
greatness I give to this friend, since what it possesses of potential 
and latent goodness I make it express actively and openly through its 
own proper activity, which is to make manifest the meaning conceived.</p>
<p>I was moved in the second place by jealousy for it. Jealousy for a 
friend makes a man solicitous to provide for the distant future. 
Thinking, therefore, that the desire to understand these canzoni would 
have induced some unlearned person to have the Latin commentary 
translated into the vernacular, and fearing that the vernacular might 
have been set down by someone who would have made it seem offensive, as 
did the one who translated the&nbsp;<i>Ethics&nbsp;</i>from Latin–and that was Thaddeus the Hippocratist–I arranged to set it down, trusting in myself more than in another.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup>&nbsp;I
 was moved to defend it from its numerous accusers who disparage it and 
commend the other vernaculars, especially the language of&nbsp;<i>oc</i>, calling that one more beautiful and better than this one, thereby departing from the truth.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup>&nbsp;For by means of this commentary the great goodness of the vernacular of&nbsp;<i>sì</i>&nbsp;will
 be seen, because its virtue will be made evident, namely how it 
expresses the loftiest and the most unusual conceptions almost as aptly,
 fully, and gracefully as Latin, something that could not be expressed 
perfectly in verse, because of the accidental adornments that are tied 
to it, that is, rhyme and meter, just as the beauty of a woman cannot be
 perfectly expressed when the adornment of her preparation and apparel 
do more to make her admired than she does herself. Therefore, if anyone 
wishes to judge a woman justly, let him look at her when her natural 
beauty alone attends her, unaccompanied by any accidental adornment; so 
it will be with this commentary, in which the smoothness of the flow of 
its syllables, the appropriateness of its constructions, and the sweet 
discourses that it makes will be seen, which anyone upon careful 
consideration will find full of the sweetest and most exquisite beauty. 
But since the most effective way of revealing the defects and the malice
 of an accuser is to examine his intentions, I will tell, in order to 
confound those who attack the Italian language, why they are moved to do
 this, and I will now write a special chapter on this subject so that 
their infamy may be rendered even more conspicuous.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="11"></a>Chapter 11</i></b></p>
<p>To the perpetual disgrace and humiliation of those contemptible men 
of Italy who praise the vernacular of others and disparage their own, I 
say that their impulse arises from five detestable causes. The first is 
blindness in discernment; the second, disingenuous excusing; the third, 
desire for glory; the fourth, reasoning prompted by envy; the fifth and 
last, baseness of mind, that is, pusillanimity. Each of these faults has
 so great a following that few are those who are free from them.</p>
<p>Of the first we may reason as follows. Just as the sensitive part of 
the soul has eyes by which it apprehends the difference in things with 
respect to their external coloring, so the rational part has its own eye
 by which it apprehends the difference in things with respect to how 
they are directed to some end: and this is discernment. Also, just as he
 who is blind in the eyes of sense always follows others in judging what
 is good and what is evil, so he who is blind to the light of 
discernment always follows the popular cry in his judgment, whether true
 or false. And so whenever the one who cries is blind, he and the other 
who leans upon him, being likewise blind, must come to a bad end. For 
this reason it is written that “if the blind lead the blind, so shall 
they both fall into the ditch.”<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup></p>
<p>This popular cry has long been turned against our vernacular, for 
reasons which will be discussed below after the present one. And the 
blind mentioned above, who are almost infinite in number, with their 
hands placed on the shoulders of these liars, have fallen into the ditch
 of false opinion from which they do not know how to escape. The common 
people especially are bereft of the habit of this discerning light 
because, being occupied from the beginning of their lives with some kind
 of trade, they direct their minds to it by force of necessity, so that 
they are mindful of nothing else. Since the habit of virtue, whether 
moral or intellectual, cannot be had of a sudden, but must be acquired 
through practice, and since they devote their practice to some craft and
 do not trouble themselves with perceiving other things, it is 
impossible for them to have discernment. As a result it often happens 
that they cry “long live their death” and “death to their life,” if 
someone but raises the cry. This is the most dangerous defect of their 
blindness. Hence Boethius deems popular glory to be vain because he sees
 that it lacks discernment.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup>These 
people should be called sheep, not men, for if a sheep were to cast 
itself over a cliff a thousand feet high, all the others would follow 
after it; and if while crossing the road a sheep for any reason leaps, 
all the others leap, even though they see nothing to leap over. I have 
seen many jump into a well after one that jumped in, perhaps believing 
that they were jumping over a wall, even though the shepherd, weeping 
and shouting, tried to check them with this arms and body.</p>
<p>The second group against our vernacular arises out of disingenuous 
excusing. There are many who love to be considered masters rather than 
to be such, and to avoid the opposite, that is, not being so considered,
 they always lay the blame on the material furnished for their craft, or
 on their tools. For example, a bad smith blames the iron supplied to 
him, and the bad lute player blames the lute, thinking to throw the 
fault of the bad knife or the bad music on the iron or the lute, and to 
remove it from himself. In the same way there are some, and not a few, 
who wish to be considered writers; and to excuse themselves from not 
writing or from writing badly, they accuse and blame their material, 
that is, their own vernacular, and praise another which they have not 
been required to work with. Whoever wishes to see in what way this iron 
is deserving of blame should look at the works which good craftsmen make
 with it and he will recognize the disingenuousness of those who think 
to excuse themselves by blaming it. Against men of this sort Tully cries
 out at the beginning of one of his books called&nbsp;<i>The Book on the End of Good</i>,
 because in his time they found fault with Roman Latin and praised the 
Greek language for reasons similar to those for which these men judge 
the Italian language vile and Provençal precious.<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup></p>
<p>The third group against our vernacular arises out of empty desire for
 glory. There are many who think that they will be more admired by 
depicting things in some other language, and by praising it, than by 
depicting things in their own. Unquestionably the talent of learning a 
foreign language well is not undeserving of praise; but it is 
blameworthy to praise it beyond the truth in order to boast of such an 
acquisition.</p>
<p>The fourth group arises out of reasoning prompted by envy. As was 
said above, envy always exists where there is some kind of common 
ground. Among men sharing the same language there is the common ground 
of the vernacular; and because one cannot use it as another person does,
 envy springs up. The envious man then argues, not by blaming him who 
writes for not knowing how to write, but by blaming that which 
constitutes the material of his work, so that by disparaging the work on
 that account he may deprive the poet of honor and fame–just like 
someone who would blame the iron of the sword in order to find fault not
 with the iron but with the whole work of the craftsman.</p>
<p>The fifth and last group is moved by baseness of mind. The 
pretentious man always magnifies himself in his heart, and likewise the 
pusillanimous, conversely, always holds himself for less than he is. 
Because magnifying and minimizing are always relative to something by 
comparison with which the pretentious man deems himself great and the 
pusillanimous himself small, it happens that the pretentious man always 
deems others to be less than they are, and the pusillanimous always 
greater. And since man measures himself in the same way he measures his 
belongings, which are almost a part of himself, it happens that the 
pretentious man’s belongings always seem to him better than they are and
 those of others worse; the pusillanimous always believes that his 
belongings are worth little and those of others worth much. Therefore 
many by means of such abasement disparage their own vernacular and 
praise that of others.</p>
<p>All of these together make up the detestable wretches of Italy who 
despise this precious vernacular, which, if it is base in anything, is 
base only insofar as it issues from the meretricious lips of these 
adulterers under whose guidance go the blind of whom I made mention in 
treating the first cause.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="12"></a>Chapter 12</i></b></p>
<p>If flames of fire were seen issuing from the windows of a house, and 
someone asked if there were a fire within, and another answered in the 
affirmative, I would not be able to judge easily which of the two was 
more deserving of ridicule. No different would be the question and 
answer if someone asked me whether love for my native tongue resides in 
me and I replied in the affirmative, for the reasons set forth above. 
But nevertheless both to demonstrate that not simply love but the most 
perfect love for it resides in me, and to censure once again its 
adversaries by demonstrating this to anyone who will rightly understand 
it, I will tell how I became its friend and then how this friendship was
 strengthened. I say then, as Tully may be seen to write in&nbsp;<i>Friendship</i>, without disagreeing with the opinion of the Philosopher expressed in the eighth and ninth books of the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>,
 that nearness and goodness are by nature the causes that engender love;
 benefit, purpose, and familiarity are the causes that increase love.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup>&nbsp;All these causes are present to engender and strengthen the love which I bear for my vernacular, as I will briefly show.</p>
<p>A thing is nearest to the extent that of all things of its kind it is
 most closely related to another thing; thus of all men the son is 
nearest to the father; of all the arts medicine is nearest to the 
doctor, and music to musician, because they are more closely related to 
them than are other arts; of all countries the nearest is the one in 
which one lives, because it is most closely related to him. And so a 
man’s vernacular is nearest to the extent that it is most closely 
related to him, for it is in his mind first and alone before any other; 
and not only is it related to him intrinsically but accidentally, since 
it is connected to those persons who are nearest to him, that is, his 
kin, his fellow citizens, and his own people. Such is one’s own 
vernacular, which is not simply near but supremely near to everyone. 
Therefore, if nearness is the seed of friendship, as has been said 
above, it is clear that it has been among the causes of love that I bear
 for my language, which is nearer to me than the others. The cause 
mentioned above, namely that that is more closely related which first 
exists alone in all the mind, induced people to adopt the custom of 
making the firstborn sole heirs, since they are the closest, and, 
because the closest, the most loved.</p>
<p>Moreover, its goodness makes me its friend. Here it should be 
observed that every goodness proper to a thing is deserving of love in 
that thing, as in masculinity to have a full beard and in femininity to 
have the entire face free of hair, just as in the foxhound to have a 
keen scent, and in the greyhound to have great speed. The more it is 
proper to it, the more it is deserving of love; thus, although every 
virtue in man is deserving of love, that is most deserving of love in 
him which is most human, and that is justice, which resides in the 
rational or intellectual part, that is, in the will. This is so 
deserving of love that, as the Philosopher says in the fifth book of 
the&nbsp;<i>Ethics</i>, they who are its enemies, such as thieves and 
robbers, love it; and therefore we see that its opposite, namely 
injustice, is hated most of all, as, for example, treachery, 
ingratitude, falsehood, theft, rapine, deceit, and the like.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>&nbsp;All
 of these are such inhuman sins that to exonerate himself from being 
disgraced by them it is granted through long custom that a person may 
speak of himself, as has been said above, and may declare himself 
faithful and loyal. Of this virtue I will speak more fully in the 
fourteenth book; and leaving it aside for now, I return to my topic.</p>
<p>It is therefore proved that there is a goodness which is most proper 
to a thing; it must now be perceived what is most loved and praised in 
it, and that will be this goodness. Now we see that in all things 
relating to speech the apt expression of thought is most loved and 
praised: therefore this is its prime goodness. Since this is found in 
our vernacular, as has been clearly shown above in another chapter, it 
is clear that this is among the causes of love which I bear for it, 
since goodness, as has been said, is the cause that engenders love.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="13"></a>Chapter 13</i></b></p>
<p>Having said how there exist in my native tongue these two 
characteristics which have made me its friend–that is, nearness to 
myself and goodness proper to it–I will tell how friendship, through 
benefits and harmony of purpose, and through a sense of benevolence born
 of long familiarity, is strengthened and increased. I say first that 
for myself I have received from it the gift of very great benefits. For 
we know that among all benefits the greatest is the one that is most 
precious to him who receives it; and nothing is so precious as the thing
 for the sake of which all other things are desired; and all other 
things are desired for the perfection of him who desires them. 
Therefore, since man has two perfections, one primary and one secondary 
(the first causes him to exist, the second causes him to be good), I 
have received, if my native tongue has been the cause of both the one 
and the other, very great benefit from it. And that it has been the 
cause of my being, and moreover of my being good–unless I should fall 
through fault of my own–may briefly be shown.</p>
<p>It is not impossible, according to the philosopher, as he says in the second book of the&nbsp;<i>Physics</i>,
 for a thing to have several efficient causes, although among them one 
is principal; thus the fire and the hammer are the efficient causes of 
the knife, although the smith is the principal one.<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup>&nbsp;This
 vernacular of mine was what brought my parents together, for they 
conversed in it, just as it is the fire that prepares the iron for the 
smith who makes the knife; and so it is evident that it has contributed 
to my generation, and so was one cause of my being. Moreover, this 
vernacular of mine was what led me into the path of knowledge which is 
our ultimate perfection, since through it I entered upon Latin and 
through its agency Latin was taught to me, which then became my path to 
further progress. So it is evident that it has been a very great 
benefactor to me, and this I acknowledge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has had the same purpose as I myself, and this I can 
show as follows. Everything by nature pursues its own preservation; thus
 if the vernacular could by itself pursue anything, it would pursue 
that; and that would be to secure itself greater stability, and greater 
stability it could gain only by binding itself with meter and with 
rhyme. This has been precisely my purpose, as is so evident that it 
requires no proof. Consequently, its purpose and mine have been one and 
the same, so that through this harmony our friendship has been 
strengthened and increased. There has also been a sense of benevolence 
born of familiarity; for from the beginning of my life I have looked on 
it with benevolence and been intimate with it, and have used it in 
deliberating, explaining, and questioning. Consequently, if friendship 
increases through familiarity, as seems plain to the senses, it is 
evident that it has been greatly increased in me, since I have used it 
all my life. And so we see that all the causes that engender and 
increase friendship have joined together in this friendship, from which 
we must conclude that not simply love but most perfect love is what I 
ought to have, and do have, for it.</p>
<p>So turning our gaze backwards and gathering together the reasons 
already noted, we can see that this bread, with which the canzoni placed
 below must be eaten, is sufficiently cleansed of its impurities and of 
being oaten. Therefore it is time to think of serving the meat. This 
commentary shall be that bread made with barley by which thousands shall
 be satiated, and my baskets shall be full to overflowing with it.<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup>&nbsp;This
 shall be a new light, a new sun which shall rise where the old sun 
shall set and which shall give light to those who lie in shadows and in 
darkness because the old sun no longer sheds its light upon them.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="N_1_"></a>1.&nbsp;<i>The Philosopher</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Aristotle, whom Dante characteristically refers to by antonomasia, 
following the traditional practice of his age. The&nbsp;<i>First Philosophy</i>&nbsp;is his&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics</i>, and the citation is to the opening line of Book I, Ch. 1.</p>
<p><a name="N_2_"></a>2.&nbsp;<i>the bread of the angels</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A metaphor signifying wisdom.</p>
<p><a name="N_3_"></a>3.&nbsp;<i>the natural thirst</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thirst for knowledge of truth. The same metaphor reappears in&nbsp;<i>Purg</i>. XXI, 1 (“La sete natural”).</p>
<p><a name="N_4_"></a>4.&nbsp;<i>I placed before their eyes some time ago</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Dante had written the three canzoni, placed at the beginning of the 
second, third, and fourth books, some ten years earlier, and now seeks 
to make their meaning more accessible by extended commentaries, which 
comprise the prose portion of these books (or treatises). The “meat” is 
the poetry, the “bread” the commentary.</p>
<p><a name="N_5_"></a>5.&nbsp;<i>the Vita Nuova</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Dante’s first literary work (c. 1295), which celebrates his youthful 
and passionate love for Beatrice. Like the&nbsp;<i>Convivio</i>, it collects a number of poems written at an earlier time and supplies a commentary on their meaning.</p>
<p><a name="N_6_"></a>6.&nbsp;<i>Self-praise is to be avoided</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the&nbsp;<i>Vita Nuova</i>, Ch. XXVIII, for a similar example of this literary topos.</p>
<p><a name="N_7_"></a>7.&nbsp;<i>Boethius</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author (d. 524) of the&nbsp;<i>De consolatione philosophiae</i>&nbsp;(<i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>), one of the literary models for the&nbsp;<i>Convivio</i>. Dante locates him among the saved in the Sphere of the Sun,&nbsp;<i>Par</i>. X, 124-129.</p>
<p><a name="N_8_"></a>8.&nbsp;<i>Augustine</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reference is to St. Augustine’s&nbsp;<i>Confessions</i>, Book XIII. He is also one of the saved in the Sphere of the Sun; see&nbsp;<i>Par</i>. XII, 130.</p>
<p><a name="N_9_"></a>9.&nbsp;<i>cast me out of her sweet bosom</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Dante was exiled from Florence on 27 January 1302 and condemned to 
death on 19 March 1302. He was in Rome at the time of his exile, and he 
never returned to his native Florence.</p>
<p><a name="N_10_"></a>10.&nbsp;<i>“Fame thrives on movement . . .”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aeneid</i>&nbsp;IV, 175.</p>
<p><a name="N_11_"></a>11.&nbsp;<i>accidental impurities</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 “Accident” and “substance” are formal terms of Scholastic philosophy, 
applied to the ruling metaphor of the bread (commentary). Substance is 
the thing itself, accident a condition in a substance. The “accidental” 
impurities are not inherent in the essence of the bread itself. The 
choice of Italian as opposed to Latin as the language of the 
commentaries is, however, a matter of substance and not of accident. The
 distinction between “oats” and “wheat” expresses the qualities of the 
Italian and Latin languages. “Oats” refers to all cereals except 
“wheat.”</p>
<p><a name="N_12_"></a>12.&nbsp;<i>Eloquence in the Vernacular</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Dante was at work on the&nbsp;<i>De vulgari eloquentia</i>&nbsp;in February of 1305, it is virtually certain that the&nbsp;<i>Convivio</i>&nbsp;was begun in the year 1304.</p>
<p><a name="N_13_"></a>13.&nbsp;<i>while Latin follows art</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Latin follows, that is, the rules of grammar and rhetoric.</p>
<p><a name="N_14_"></a>14.&nbsp;<i>the wise say</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See, for example, Seneca,&nbsp;<i>De beneficiis</i>&nbsp;II, 1; II, 17; IV, 9.</p>
<p><a name="N_15_"></a>15.&nbsp;<i>Thus Martin is used to saying</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Martin and John are conventional names, typical of the Scholastic 
practice (compare Thomas Aquinas,&nbsp;<i>S.T.</i>&nbsp;I, 119, 1r.).</p>
<p><a name="N_16_"></a>16.&nbsp;<i>This is why Seneca says</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>De beneficiis</i>&nbsp;II, 1.</p>
<p><a name="N_17_"></a>17.&nbsp;<i>the Law</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<i>Corpus iuris</i>, or Roman Law. The citation is from the&nbsp;<i>Digest</i>&nbsp;I, 4, 2.</p>
<p><a name="N_18_"></a>18.&nbsp;<i>Thaddeus the Hippocratist</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 A Florentine physician and author (1235-1295), known for his commentary
 to Hippocrates in addition to a translation of Aristotle’s&nbsp;<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>.</p>
<p><a name="N_19_"></a>19.&nbsp;<i>language of oc</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words&nbsp;<i>oc</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>sì</i>&nbsp;signify “yes” in the Provençal and Italian vernacular languages, respectively.</p>
<p><a name="N_20_"></a>20.&nbsp;<i>“if the blind lead the blind . . .”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew 15:14.</p>
<p><a name="N_21_"></a>21.&nbsp;<i>Boethius deems popular glory to be vain</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>De consolatione philosophiae</i>&nbsp;III, 6, 5.</p>
<p><a name="N_22_"></a>22.&nbsp;<i>Tully</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The traditional name for Marcus Tullius Cicero. The reference is to&nbsp;<i>De finibus</i>&nbsp;I, 1.</p>
<p><a name="N_23_"></a>23.&nbsp;<i>Tully</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cicero,&nbsp;<i>De amicitia</i>&nbsp;V ff.</p>
<p><a name="N_24_"></a>24.&nbsp;<i>in the fifth book of the Ethics</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dante misquotes the source for this passage, which is from Cicero,&nbsp;<i>De officiis&nbsp;</i>II, 2.</p>
<p><a name="N_25_"></a>25.&nbsp;<i>second book of the Physics</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See St. Thomas’&nbsp;<i>Commentary</i>&nbsp;to the second book of the&nbsp;<i>Physics</i>, lect. 5.</p>
<p><a name="N_26_"></a>26.&nbsp;<i>by which thousands shall be satiated</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These lines echo John 6:5-13.</p>
<p><a name="N_27_"></a>27.&nbsp;<i>the new light</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The metaphor refers not to the vernacular as opposed to Latin, but to 
the commentary in the vernacular as opposed to other works by other 
authors in the vernacular (Chiappelli).</p>
